Inside the mobile system, software will abstract some characteristics of the environment. This abstraction may map directly to a sensor, such as with measurement of temperature or pressure, or it may integrate the input of several sensors, such as pedestrians identified in a self-driving automobile controller. An actuator is the reverse of a sensor: It takes a digital representation as input and causes some action in the environment. The lane keep assist feature in an automobile utilizes actuators, as does an audio alert from your smartphone. #### The Architectâ€™s Concerns An architect has several concerns with respect to sensors: *  How to create an accurate representation of the environment based on the sensor inputs. *  How the system should respond to that representation of the environment. *  Security and privacy of the sensor data and actuator commands. *  Degraded operation. If sensors fail or become unreadable, the system should enter a degraded mode. For example, if GPS readings are not available in tunnels, the system can use dead reckoning techniques to estimate location.
