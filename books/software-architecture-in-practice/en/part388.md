*  Revoke access. If the system or a system administrator believes that an attack is under way, then access can be severely limited to sensitive resources, even for normally legitimate users and uses. For example, if your desktop has been compromised by a virus, your access to certain resources may be limited until the virus is removed from your system. *  Restrict login. Repeated failed login attempts may indicate a potential attack. Many systems limit access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer. Of course, legitimate users may make mistakes in attempting to log in, so the limited access may last for only a certain time period. In some cases, systems double the lockout time period after each unsuccessful login attempt. *  Inform actors. Ongoing attacks may require action by operators, other personnel, or cooperating systems. Such personnel or systems—the set of relevant actors—must be notified when the system has detected an attack.
