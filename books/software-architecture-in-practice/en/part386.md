*  Limit exposure. This tactic focuses on minimizing the effects of damage caused by a hostile action. It is a passive defense since it does not proactively prevent attackers from doing harm. Limiting exposure is typically realized by reducing the amount of data or services that can be accessed through a single access point, and hence compromised in a single attack. *  Encrypt data. Confidentiality is usually achieved by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication. Encryption provides extra protection to persistently maintained data beyond that available from authorization. Communication links, by comparison, may not have authorization controls. In such cases, encryption is the only protection for passing data over publicly accessible communication links. Encryption can be symmetric (readers and writers use the same key) or asymmetric (with readers and writers use paired public and private keys). *  Separate entities. Separating different entities limits the scope of an attack. Separation within the system can be done through physical separation on different servers attached to different networks, the use of virtual machines, or an “air gap”—that is, by having no electronic connection between different portions of a system. Finally, sensitive data is frequently separated from nonsensitive data to reduce the possibility of attack by users who have access to nonsensitive data.
