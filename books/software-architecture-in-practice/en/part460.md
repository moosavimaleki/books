[Figure 14.2](ch14.xhtml#ch14fig02) shows a simple queuing model for performance. Such models are widely used to analyze the latency and throughput of various types of queuing systems, including manufacturing and service environments, as well as computer systems. ![An illustration of a generic queueing model.](graphics/14fig02.jpg) Figure 14.2 A generic queuing model The model of generic queueing is depicted. The arrivals are sent to a queue block that is connected to a server of the scheduling algorithm. The routing of messages is done and the output from the scheduling algorithm server is sent into two different queues followed by a scheduling algorithm server. The final results are out from the final server. Within this model, seven parameters can affect the latency that the model predicts: *  Arrival rate *  Queuing discipline *  Scheduling algorithm *  Service time *  Topology *  Network bandwidth *  Routing algorithm These are the only parameters that can affect latency within this model. This is what gives the model its power. Furthermore, each of these parameters can be affected by various architectural decisions. This is what makes the model useful for an architect. For example, the routing algorithm can be fixed or it could be a load-balancing algorithm. A scheduling algorithm must be chosen. The topology can be affected by dynamically adding or removing new servers. And so forth.
