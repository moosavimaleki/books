Some other defined mode of the system Response The system will process the stimulus. Processing the stimulus will take time. This time may be required for computation, or it may be required because processing is blocked by contention for shared resources. Requests can fail to be satisfied because the system is overloaded or because of a failure somewhere in the processing chain. *  System returns a response *  System returns an error *  System generates no response *  System ignores the request if overloaded *  System changes the mode or level of service *  System services a higher-priority event *  System consumes resources Response measure Timing measures can include latency or throughput. Systems with timing deadlines can also measure jitter of response and ability to meet the deadlines. Measuring how many of the requests go unsatisfied is also a type of measure, as is how much of a computing resource (e.g., a CPU, memory, thread pool, buffer) is utilized.
