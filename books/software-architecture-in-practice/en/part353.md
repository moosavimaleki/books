#### Unsafe State Detection ##### Timeout The timeout tactic is used to determine whether the operation of a component is meeting its timing constraints. This might be realized in the form of an exception being raised, to indicate the failure of a component if its timing constraints are not met. Thus this tactic can detect late timing and omission failures. Timeout is a particularly common tactic in real-time or embedded systems and distributed systems. It is related to the availability tactics of system monitor, heartbeat, and ping-echo. ##### Timestamp As described in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04), the timestamp tactic is used to detect incorrect sequences of events, primarily in distributed message-passing systems. A timestamp of an event can be established by assigning the state of a local clock to the event immediately after the event occurs. Sequence numbers can also be used for this purpose, since timestamps in a distributed system may be inconsistent across different processors.
