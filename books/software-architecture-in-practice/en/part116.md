To translate these generic attribute characterizations into requirements for a particular system, the general scenarios need to be made system specific. But, as we have found, it is much easier for a stakeholder to tailor a general scenario into one that fits their system than it is for them to generate a scenario from thin air. [Figure 3.1](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig01) shows the parts of a quality attribute scenario just discussed. [Figure 3.2](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig02) shows an example of a general scenario, in this instance for availability. ![A figure depicts the parts of a quality attribute scenario.](graphics/03fig01.jpg) Figure 3.1 The parts of a quality attribute scenario The parts of a quality attribute scenario are illustrated through a diagram. A point in the left with a finger pressing the point is labeled as 1-source. A rectangle in the center is marked as 4-environment. The inside area of the rectangle is labeled as 3-artifact. A right arrow connecting the source to the environment is labeled as 2-stimulus. A circle on the right is marked as a 6-response measure. A right arrow connecting the environment to the response measure is labeled as 5-response. The circle shows the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the inside left. Signs of a zigzag line, a left arrow, a right arrow, and vertical bars are shown inside the circle.
