*  Spare (cold spare). Cold sparing refers to a configuration in which redundant spares remain out of service until a failover occurs, at which point a power-on-reset[4](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn4a) procedure is initiated on the redundant spare prior to its being placed in service. Due to its poor recovery performance, and hence its high mean time to repair, this pattern is poorly suited to systems having high-availability requirements. [4](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn4). A power-on-reset ensures that a device starts operating in a known state. Benefits: The benefit of a redundant spare is a system that continues to function correctly after only a brief delay in the presence of a failure. The alternative is a system that stops functioning correctly, or stops functioning altogether, until the failed component is repaired. This repair could take hours or days. Tradeoffs: The tradeoff with any of these patterns is the additional cost and complexity incurred in providing a spare. The tradeoff among the three alternatives is the time to recover from a failure versus the runtime cost incurred to keep a spare up-to-date. A hot spare carries the highest cost but leads to the fastest recovery time, for example.
