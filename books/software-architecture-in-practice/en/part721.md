## 22 Documenting an Architecture Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self. —Damian Conway Creating an architecture isn’t enough. It has to be communicated in a way to let its stakeholders use it properly to do their jobs. If you go to the trouble of creating a strong architecture, one that you expect to stand the test of time, then you must go to the trouble of describing it in enough detail, without ambiguity, and organized so that others can quickly find and update needed information. Documentation speaks for the architect. It speaks for the architect today, when the architect should be doing other things besides answering a hundred questions about the architecture. And it speaks for the architect tomorrow, who has forgotten the details of what the architecture includes, or when that person has left the project and someone else is now the architect.
