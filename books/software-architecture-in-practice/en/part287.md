*  If many instances of layer bridging occur, the system may not meet its portability and modifiability goals, which strict layering helps to achieve. #### Publish-Subscribe Pattern Publish-subscribe is an architectural pattern in which components communicate primarily through asynchronous messages, sometimes referred to as “events” or “topics.” The publishers have no knowledge of the subscribers, and subscribers are only aware of message types. Systems using the publish-subscribe pattern rely on implicit invocation; that is, the component publishing a message does not directly invoke any other component. Components publish messages on one or more events or topics, and other components register an interest in the publication. At runtime, when a message is published, the publish–subscribe (or event) bus notifies all of the elements that registered an interest in the event or topic. In this way, the message publication causes an implicit invocation of (methods in) other components. The result is loose coupling between the publishers and the subscribers.
