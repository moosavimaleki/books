Regardless of the level of formality, always remember that different notations are better (or worse) for expressing different kinds of information. Formality aside, no UML class diagram will help you reason about schedulability, nor will a sequence diagram tell you very much about the system’s likelihood of being delivered on time. You should choose your notations and representation languages while keeping in mind the important issues you need to capture and reason about. ### 22.3 Views Perhaps the most important concept associated with software architecture documentation is that of the view. A software architecture is a complex entity that cannot be described in a simple one-dimensional fashion. A view is a representation of a set of system elements and relations among them—not all system elements, but those of a particular type. For example, a layered view of a system would show elements of type “layer”; that is, it would show the system’s decomposition into layers, along with the relations among those layers. A pure layered view would not, however, show the system’s services, or clients and servers, or data model, or any other type of element.
