*  There is a tradeoff between increasing the level of replication, which raises the cost, and the resulting availability. In systems employing TMR, the statistical likelihood of two or more components failing is vanishingly small, and three components represents a sweet spot between availability and cost. *  Circuit breaker. A commonly used availability tactic is retry. In the event of a timeout or fault when invoking a service, the invoker simply tries again—and again, and again. A circuit breaker keeps the invoker from trying countless times, waiting for a response that never comes. In this way, it breaks the endless retry cycle when it deems that the system is dealing with a fault. That’s the signal for the system to begin handling the fault. Until the circuit break is “reset,” subsequent invocations will return immediately without passing along the service request. Benefits: This pattern can remove from individual components the policy about how many retries to allow before declaring a failure.
