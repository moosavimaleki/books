How other resources will behave differently in the future as the result of using this resource. For example, if you ask a resource to destroy an object, trying to access that object in the future through other resources could produce an error as a result. Humanly observable results. These are prevalent in embedded systems. For example, calling a program that turns on a display in a cockpit has a very observable effect—the display comes on. In addition, the statement of semantics should make it clear whether the execution of the resource will be atomic or may be suspended or interrupted. *  Assignment of values to data that the actor invoking the resource can access. The value assignment might be as simple as setting the value of a return argument or as far-reaching as updating a central database. *  Assumptions about the values crossing the interface. *  Changes in the element’s state brought about by using the resource. This includes exceptional conditions, such as side effects from a partially completed operation.
