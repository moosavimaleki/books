2.  The architect (or architecture team) should, on an ongoing basis, base the architecture on a prioritized list of well-specified quality attribute requirements. These will inform the tradeoffs that always occur. Functionality matters less. 3.  The architecture should be documented using views. (A view is simply a representation of one or more architectural structures.) The views should address the concerns of the most important stakeholders in support of the project timeline. This might mean minimal documentation at first, with the documentation then being elaborated later. Concerns usually are related to construction, analysis, and maintenance of the system, as well as education of new stakeholders. 4.  The architecture should be evaluated for its ability to deliver the systemâ€™s important quality attributes. This should occur early in the life cycle, when it returns the most benefit, and repeated as appropriate, to ensure that changes to the architecture (or the environment for which it is intended) have not rendered the design obsolete.
