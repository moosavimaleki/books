What can architects do in the meantime? First, pay attention to breaking developments. If the systems you are working on today involve areas that quantum computing is likely to affect (or, more likely, completely turn on its head), isolate those parts of the system to minimize the disruption when quantum computing finally shows up. Especially for secure systems, follow the field to find out what to do when your conventional encryption algorithms become worthless. But your preparation need not all be defensive. Imagine what you could do with a communication network that is able to transfer information instantly, no matter the physical distance between the nodes. If this sounds far-fetchedâ€”well, so did flying machines once upon a time. As always, we await the future with eagerness. ### 26.7 For Further Reading General overview: *  Programming Quantum Computers by Eric Johnston, Nic Harrigan, and Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia discusses quantum computing without reference to physics or linear algebra [[Johnston 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_131)].
