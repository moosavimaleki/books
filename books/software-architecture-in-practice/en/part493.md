##### Protocol Buffers The Protocol Buffer technology originated at Google and was used internally for several years before being released as open source in 2008. Like JSON, Protocol Buffers use data types that are close to programming-language data types, making serialization and deserialization efficient. As with XML, Protocol Buffer messages have a schema that defines a valid structure, and that schema can specify both required and optional elements and nested elements. However, unlike both XML and JSON, Protocol Buffers are a binary format, so they are extremely compact and use memory and network bandwidth resources quite efficiently. In this respect, Protocol Buffers harken back to a much earlier binary representation called Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), which originated in the early 1980s when network bandwidth was a precious resource and no bit could be wasted. The Protocol Buffers open source project provides code generators to allow easy use of Protocol Buffers with many programming languages. You specify your message schema in a proto file, which is then compiled by a language-specific protocol buffer compiler. The procedures generated by the compilers will be used by an actor to serialize and by an element to deserialize the data.
