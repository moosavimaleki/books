The techniques outlined in this chapter are intended to discover possible hazards that could result from the systemâ€™s operation and help in creating strategies to cope with these hazards. ### 10.1 Safety General Scenario With this background, we can construct the general scenario for safety, shown in [Table 10.1](ch10.xhtml#ch10tab01). Table 10.1 Safety General Scenario Portion ofScenario Description Possible Values Source A data source (a sensor, a software component that calculates a value, a communication channel), a time source (clock), or a user action Specific instances of a: *  Sensor *  Software component *  Communication channel *  Device (such as a clock) Stimulus An omission, commission, or occurrence of incorrect data or timing A specific instance of an omission: *  A value never arrives. *  A function is never performed. A specific instance of a commission: *  A function is performed incorrectly. *  A device produces a spurious event. *  A device produces incorrect data.
