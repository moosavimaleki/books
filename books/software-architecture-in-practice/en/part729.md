Thus views let us divide the multidimensional entity that is a software architecture into a number of (we hope) interesting and manageable representations of the system. The concept of views leads to a basic principle of architecture documentation: Documenting an architecture is a matter of documenting the relevant views and then adding documentation that applies to more than one view. What are the relevant views? This depends entirely on your goals. As we saw previously, architecture documentation can serve many purposes: a mission statement for implementers, a basis for analysis, the specification for automatic code generation, the starting point for system understanding and reverse engineering, or the blueprint for project estimation and planning. Different views also expose different quality attributes to different degrees. In turn, the quality attributes that are of most concern to you and the other stakeholders in the system’s development will affect which views you choose to document. For instance, a module view will let you reason about your system’s maintainability, a deployment view will let you reason about your system’s performance and reliability, and so forth.
