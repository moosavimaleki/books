*  Hardware engineers often use preparation and repair tactics. Examples include error detection and correction (EDAC) coding, forward error correction (FEC), and temporal redundancy. EDAC coding is typically used to protect control memory structures in high-availability distributed real-time embedded systems [[Hamming 80](ref01.xhtml#ref_107)]. Conversely, FEC coding is typically employed to recover from physical layer errors occurring in external network links [[Morelos-Zaragoza 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_184)]. Temporal redundancy involves sampling spatially redundant clock or data lines at time intervals that exceed the pulse width of any transient pulse to be tolerated, and then voting out any defects detected [[Mavis 02](ref01.xhtml#ref_175)]. Tactics for availability—fault prevention: *  Parnas and Madey have written about increasing an element’s competence set [[Parnas 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_208)]. *  The ACID properties, important in the transactions tactic, were introduced by Gray in the 1970s and discussed in depth in [[Gray 93](ref01.xhtml#ref_104)]. Disaster recovery: *  A disaster is an event such as an earthquake, flood, or hurricane that destroys an entire data center. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identifies eight different types of plans that should be considered in the event of a disaster, See [Section 2.2](ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec2) of NIST Special Publication 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems, [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-34r1.pdf).
