##### Step 8: Analyze the Architectural Approaches After the scenarios have been collected and prioritized in step 7, the evaluation team guides the architect in the process of analyzing the highest-ranked scenarios. The architect explains how architectural decisions contribute to realizing each scenario. Ideally, this activity will be dominated by the architect’s explanation of scenarios in terms of previously discussed architectural approaches. In this step the evaluation team performs the same activities as in step 6, using the highest-ranked, newly generated scenarios. Typically, this step might cover the top five to ten scenarios, as time permits. ##### Step 9: Present the Results In step 9, the evaluation team convenes and groups risks into risk themes, based on some common underlying concern or systemic deficiency. For example, a group of risks about inadequate or out-of-date documentation might be grouped into a risk theme stating that documentation is given insufficient consideration. A group of risks about the system’s inability to function in the face of various hardware and/or software failures might lead to a risk theme about insufficient attention to backup capability or providing high availability.
