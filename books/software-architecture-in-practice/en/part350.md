![A sample concrete safety scenario is presented.](graphics/10fig01.jpg) Figure 10.1 Sample concrete safety scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a sensor. The stimulus fails to report a life-critical value after 100 ms. The artifact is the patient monitoring system. The environment is the normal operations. The response is the failure is logged, a warning light is illuminated on the console, and a backup (lower fidelity) sensor is engaged; the system monitors the patient using the backup sensor. The response measure is after no more than 300 ms. ### 10.2 Tactics for Safety Safety tactics may be broadly categorized as unsafe state avoidance, unsafe state detection, or unsafe state remediation. [Figure 10.2](ch10.xhtml#ch10fig02) shows the goal of the set of safety tactics. ![The goal of safety tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the unsafe state entered or imminent. The response is unsafe state detected, avoided, or contained; recovery occurs; and safe operation continues.](graphics/10fig02.jpg)
