*  Response measure. When the response occurs, it should be measurable in some fashion so that the scenario can be tested—that is, so that we can determine if the architect achieved it. For performance, this could be a measure of latency or throughput; for modifiability, it could be the labor or wall clock time required to make, test, and deploy the modification. These four characteristics of a scenario are the heart of our quality attribute specifications. But two more characteristics are important, yet often overlooked: environment and artifact. *  Environment. The environment is the set of circumstances in which the scenario takes place. Often this refers to a runtime state: The system may be in an overload condition or in normal operation, or some other relevant state. For many systems, “normal” operation can refer to one of a number of modes. For these kinds of systems, the environment should specify in which mode the system is executing. But the environment can also refer to states in which the system is not running at all: when it is in development, or testing, or refreshing its data, or recharging its battery between runs. The environment sets the context for the rest of the scenario. For example, a request for a modification that arrives after the code has been frozen for a release may be treated differently than one that arrives before the freeze. The fifth successive failure of a component may be treated differently than the first failure of that component.
