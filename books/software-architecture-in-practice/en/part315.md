*  Increase efficiency of resource usage. Improving the efficiency of algorithms used in critical areas can decrease latency and improve throughput and resource consumption. This is, for some programmers, their primary performance tactic. If the system does not perform adequately, they try to “tune up” their processing logic. As you can see, this approach is actually just one of many tactics available. #### Manage Resources Even if the demand for resources is not controllable, the management of these resources can be. Sometimes one resource can be traded for another. For example, intermediate data may be kept in a cache or it may be regenerated depending on which resources are more critical: time, space, or network bandwidth. Here are some resource management tactics: *  Increase resources. Faster processors, additional processors, additional memory, and faster networks all have the potential to improve performance. Cost is usually a consideration in the choice of resources, but increasing the resources is, in many cases, the cheapest way to get immediate improvement.
