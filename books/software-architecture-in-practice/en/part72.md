7.  The architecture dictates the structure of an organization, or vice versa. 8.  An architecture can provide the basis for incremental development. 9.  An architecture is the key artifact that allows the architect and the project manager to reason about cost and schedule. 10.  An architecture can be created as a transferable, reusable model that forms the heart of a product line. 11.  Architecture-based development focuses attention on the assembly of components, rather than simply on their creation. 12.  By restricting design alternatives, architecture channels the creativity of developers, reducing design and system complexity. 13.  An architecture can be the foundation for training of a new team member. Even if you already believe us that architecture is important and donâ€™t need that point hammered home 13 more times, think of these 13 points (which form the outline for this chapter) as 13 useful ways to use architecture in a project, or to justify the resources devoted to architecture.
