*  Behavioral semantic distance. The cooperating elements must agree on behavior, particularly with respect to the states and modes of the system. For example, a data element may be interpreted differently in system startup, shutdown, or recovery mode. Such states and modes may, in some cases, be explicitly captured in protocols. As another example, Ci and Cj may make different assumptions regarding control, such as each expecting the other to initiate interactions. *  Temporal distance. The cooperating elements must agree on assumptions about time. Examples of temporal distance include operating at different rates (e.g., one element emits values at a rate of 10 Hz and the other expects values at 60 Hz) or making different timing assumptions (e.g., one element expects event A to follow event B and the other element expects event A to follow event B with no more than 50 ms latency). While this might be considered to be a subcase of behavioral semantics, it is so important (and often subtle) that we call it out explicitly.
