Speaking of raising the level of abstraction, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has emerged as a potent force in the engineering field over the last decade or so. MBSE is the formalized application of modeling to support (among other things) system design. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) ranks MBSE as one of a select set of “transformational enablers” that underlie the entire discipline of systems engineering. A model is a graphical, mathematical, or physical representation of a concept or a construct that can be reasoned about. INCOSE is trying to move the engineering field from a document-based mentality to a model-based mentality, where structural models, behavioral models, performance models, and more are all used consistently to build systems better, faster, and cheaper. MBSE per se is beyond the scope of this book, but we can’t help but notice that what is being modeled is architecture. And who builds the models? Architects.
