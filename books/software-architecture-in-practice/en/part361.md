Does the system employ comparison to detect unsafe states, by comparing the outputs produced based on the number of synchronized or replicated elements? Containment: Redundancy Do you use replication—clones of a component—to protect against random failures of hardware? Do you use functional redundancy to address the common-mode failures by implementing diversely designed components? Containment: Redundancy Do you use analytic redundancy—functional “replicas” that include high assurance/high performance and low assurance/low performance alternatives—to be able to tolerate specification errors? Containment: Limit Consequences Can the system abort an operation that is determined to be unsafe before it can cause damage? Does the system provide controlled degradation, where the most critical system functions are maintained in the presence of component failures, while less critical functions are dropped or degraded? Does the system mask a fault by comparing the results of several redundant components and employ a voting procedure in case one or more of the components differ?
