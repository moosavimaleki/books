*  Safety. The architect needs to determine which states of the system can safely support an update. For example, updating a carâ€™s engine control software while the vehicle is driving down the highway is a bad idea. This, in turn, implies that the system needs to be aware of safety-relevant states with respect to updates. *  Partial system deployment. Re-deploying a total application or large subsystem will consume both bandwidth and time. The application or subsystem should be architected so that the portions that change frequently can be easily updated. This calls for a specific type of modifiability (see [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08)) and an attention to deployability (see [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05)). In addition, updates should be easy and automated. Accessing physical portions of a device to update them may be awkward. Returning to the engine controller example, updating the controller software should not require access to the engine. *  Extendability. Mobile vehicle systems tend to have relatively long lifetimes. Retrofitting cars, trains, airplanes, satellites, and so forth will likely become necessary at some point. Retrofitting means adding new technology to old systems, either by replacement or addition. This could occur for the following reasons:
