### 2.12 Restricting the Vocabulary of Design Alternatives As useful architectural solutions are collected, it becomes clear that although software elements can be combined in more or less infinite ways, there is something to be gained by voluntarily restricting ourselves to a relatively small number of choices of elements and their interactions. By doing so, we minimize the design complexity of the system we are building. A software engineer is not an artiste where creativity and freedom are paramount. Instead, engineering is about discipline, and discipline comes, in part, by restricting the vocabulary of alternatives to proven solutions. Examples of these proven design solutions include tactics and patterns, which will be discussed extensively in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02). Reusing off-the-shelf elements is another approach to restricting your design vocabulary. Restricting your design vocabulary to proven solutions can yield the following benefits: *  Enhanced reuse *  More regular and simpler designs that are more easily understood and communicated, and bring more reliably predictable outcomes
