2.  VMs must be managed. For example, they must be created and destroyed, among other things. Managing VMs is a function of the hypervisor. The hypervisor does not decide on its own to create or destroy a VM, but rather acts on instructions from a user or, more frequently, from a cloud infrastructure (you’ll read more about this in [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17)). The process of creating a VM involves loading a VM image (discussed in the next section). In addition to creating and destroying VMs, the hypervisor monitors them. Health checks and resource usage are part of the monitoring. The hypervisor is also located inside the defensive security perimeter of the VMs, as a defense against attacks. Finally, the hypervisor is responsible for ensuring that a VM does not exceed its resource utilization limits. Each VM has limits on CPU utilization, memory, and disk and network I/O bandwidth. Before starting a VM, the hypervisor first ensures that sufficient physical resources are available to satisfy that VM’s needs, and then the hypervisor enforces those limits while the VM is running.
