#### Containment Containment tactics seek to limit the harm associated with an unsafe state that has been entered. This category includes three subcategories: redundancy, limit consequences, and barrier. ##### Redundancy The redundancy tactics, at first glance, appear to be similar to the various sparing/redundancy tactics presented in the discussion of availability. Clearly, these tactics overlap, but since the goals of safety and availability are different, the use of backup components differs. In the realm of safety, redundancy enables the system to continue operation in the case where a total shutdown or further degradation would be undesirable. Replication is the simplest redundancy tactic, as it just involves having clones of a component. Having multiple copies of identical components can be effective in protecting against random failures of hardware, but it cannot protect against design or implementation errors in hardware or software since there is no form of diversity embedded in this tactic.
