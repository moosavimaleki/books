Building the infrastructure and building the application functionality can go hand in hand. Design and build a little infrastructure to support a little end-to-end functionality; repeat until done. Many systems are built as skeletal systems that can be extended using plug-ins, packages, or extensions. Examples include the R language, Visual Studio Code, and most web browsers. The extensions, when added, provide additional functionality over and above what is present in the skeleton. This approach aids the development process by ensuring that the system is executable early in the product’s life cycle. The fidelity of the system increases as extensions are added, or early versions are replaced by more complete versions of these parts of the software. In some cases, the parts may be low-fidelity versions or prototypes of the final functionality; in other cases, they may be surrogates that consume and produce data at the appropriate rates but do little else. Among other things, this allows potential performance (and other) problems to be identified early in the product’s life cycle.
