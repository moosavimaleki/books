Applying this concept to architecture evaluation, you can see that if the system being constructed costs millions or billions of dollars or has large safety-critical implications, then the impact of a risk event will be large. By comparison, if the system is a console-based game costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to create, then the impact of a risk event will be considerably smaller. The probability of a risk event is related to, among other things, how precedented or unprecedented the system under development and its architecture are. If you and your organization have long and deep experience in this domain, then the probability of producing a bad architecture is less than if this project is your first go. Thus evaluations act like an insurance policy. How much insurance you need depends on how exposed you are to the risk of an unsuitable architecture and your risk tolerance.
