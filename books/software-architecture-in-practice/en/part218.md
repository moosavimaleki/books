Energy managed or saved in terms of: *  Maximum/average kilowatt load on the system *  Average/total amount of energy saved *  Total kilowatt hours used *  Time period during which the system must stay powered on . . . while still maintaining a required level of functionality and acceptable levels of other quality attributes [Figure 6.1](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig01) illustrates a concrete energy efficiency scenario: A manager wants to save energy at runtime by deallocating unused resources at non-peak periods. The system deallocates resources while maintaining worst-case latency of 2 seconds on database queries, saving on average 50 percent of the total energy required. ![A sample energy efficiency scenario is displayed.](graphics/06fig01.jpg) Figure 6.1 Sample energy efficiency scenario The general quality attribute scenario is depicted. The source is the manager. The stimulus wants to save energy at runtime by deallocating unused resources at non-peak periods. The artifact is the system. The environment is the non-peak period. The response is the system deallocates resources. The response measure is maintaining worst-case latency of 2 seconds on database queries, saving on average 50 percent of the total energy required.
