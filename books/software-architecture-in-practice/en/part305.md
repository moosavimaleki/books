*  Processing time and resource usage. Processing consumes resources, which takes time. Events are handled by the execution of one or more components, whose time expended is a resource. Hardware resources include CPU, data stores, network communication bandwidth, and memory. Software resources include entities defined by the system under design. For example, thread pools and buffers must be managed and access to critical sections must be made sequential. For example, suppose a message is generated by one component. It might be placed on the network, after which it arrives at another component. It is then placed in a buffer; transformed in some fashion; processed according to some algorithm; transformed for output; placed in an output buffer; and sent onward to some component, another system, or some actor. Each of these steps contributes to the overall latency and resource consumption of the processing of that event. Different resources behave differently as their utilization approaches their capacityâ€”that is, as they become saturated. For example, as a CPU becomes more heavily loaded, performance usually degrades fairly steadily. In contrast, when you start to run out of memory, at some point the page swapping becomes overwhelming and performance crashes suddenly.
