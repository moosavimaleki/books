In case after case, we have seen these kinds of returns on investment. Once the architecture debts have been identified, they can be paid down and life becomes measurably better for the project, in terms of its feature velocity and bug-fixing time, in a way that more than pays for the effort involved. ### 23.4 Automation This form of architectural analysis can be fully automated. Each of the anti-patterns introduced in [Section 23.2](ch23.xhtml#ch23lev1sec2) can be identified in an automated fashion and the tooling can be built into a continuous integration tool suite so that architecture debt is continuously monitored. This analysis process requires the following tools: *  A tool to extract a set of issues from an issue tracker *  A tool to extract a log from a revision control system *  A tool to reverse-engineer the code base, to determine the syntactic dependencies among files *  A tool to build DSMs from the extracted information and walk through the DSM looking for the anti-patterns
