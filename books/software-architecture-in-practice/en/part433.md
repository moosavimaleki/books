The system should: *  Provide the user with the features needed *  Anticipate the userâ€™s needs *  Provide appropriate feedback to the user Response measure How is the response measured? One or more of the following: *  Task time *  Number of errors *  Learning time *  Ratio of learning time to task time *  Number of tasks accomplished *  User satisfaction *  Gain of user knowledge *  Ratio of successful operations to total operations *  Amount of time or data lost when an error occurs [Figure 13.1](ch13.xhtml#ch13fig01) gives an example of a concrete usability scenario that you could generate using [Table 13.1](ch13.xhtml#ch13tab01): The user downloads a new application and is using it productively after 2 minutes of experimentation. ![A sample usability scenario is presented.](graphics/13fig01.jpg) Figure 13.1 Sample usability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a user. The stimulus downloads a new application. The artifact is the existing platform. The environment is the runtime. The response is using it productively. The response measure is after only 2 minutes of experimentation.
