ASRs can be extracted from a requirements document, captured from stakeholders during a workshop (e.g., a QAW), captured from the architect in a utility tree, or derived from business goals. It is helpful to record them in one place so that the list can be reviewed, referenced, used to justify design decisions, and revisited over time or in the case of major system changes. In gathering these requirements, you should be mindful of the organization’s business goals. Business goals can be expressed in a common, structured form and represented as business goal scenarios. Such goals may be elicited and documented using PALM, a structured facilitation method. A useful representation of QA requirements is a utility tree. Such a graphical depiction helps to capture these requirements in a structured form, starting from coarse, abstract notions of QAs and gradually refining them to the point where they are captured as scenarios. These scenarios are then prioritized, with this prioritized set defining your “marching orders” as an architect.
