[2](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn2). These tactics deal with runtime means to prevent faults from occurring. Of course, an excellent way to prevent faults—at least in the system you’re building, if not in systems that your system must interact with—is to produce high-quality code. This can be done by means of code inspections, pair programming, solid requirements reviews, and a host of other good engineering practices. *  Removal from service. This tactic refers to temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state for the purpose of mitigating potential system failures. For example, a component of a system might be taken out of service and reset to scrub latent faults (such as memory leaks, fragmentation, or soft errors in an unprotected cache) before the accumulation of faults reaches the service-affecting level, resulting in system failure. Other terms for this tactic are software rejuvenation and therapeutic reboot. If you reboot your computer every night, you are practicing removal from service.
