Now you can move the LAMP stack container image to a different location for production use. The initial move requires moving all the elements of the stack. Suppose, however, you update PHP to a newer version and move this revised stack into production (Step 7 in the preceding process). The container management system knows that only PHP was revised and moves only the PHP layer of the image. This saves the effort involved in moving the rest of the stack. Since changing a software component within an image happens much more frequently than initial image creation, placing a new version of the container into production becomes a much faster process than it would be using a VM. Whereas loading a VM takes on the order of minutes, loading a new version of a container takes on the order of microseconds or milliseconds. Note that this process works only with the uppermost layer of the stack. If, for example, you wanted to update MySQL with a newer version, you would need to execute Steps 5 through 7 in the earlier list.
