#### Recover from Attacks Once a system has detected and attempted to resist an attack, it needs to recover. Part of recovery is restoration of services. For example, additional servers or network connections may be kept in reserve for such a purpose. Since a successful attack can be considered a kind of failure, the set of availability tactics (from [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)) that deal with recovering from a failure can be brought to bear for this aspect of security as well. In addition to the availability tactics for recovery, the audit and nonrepudiation tactics can be used: *  Audit. We audit systems—that is, keep a record of user and system actions and their effects—to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker. We may analyze audit trails to attempt to prosecute attackers or to create better defenses in the future. *  Nonrepudiation. This tactic guarantees that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. For example, you cannot deny ordering something from the Internet, and the merchant cannot disclaim getting your order. This could be achieved with some combination of digital signatures and authentication by trusted third parties.
