A description of the software architecture, as it is mapped to hardware and networking components, allows reasoning about qualities such as performance and reliability. A description of the system architecture will allow reasoning about additional qualities such as power consumption, weight, and physical dimensions. When designing a particular system, there is frequently negotiation between the system architect and the software architect over the distribution of functionality and, consequently, the constraints placed on the software architecture. Enterprise Architecture Enterprise architecture is a description of the structure and behavior of an organization’s processes, information flow, personnel, and organizational subunits. An enterprise architecture need not include computerized information systems—clearly, organizations had architectures that fit the preceding definition prior to the advent of computers—but these days enterprise architectures for all but the smallest businesses are unthinkable without information system support. Thus a modern enterprise architecture is concerned with how software systems support the enterprise’s business processes and goals. Typically included in this set of concerns is a process for deciding which systems with which functionality the enterprise should support.
