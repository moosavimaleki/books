## 25 Architecture Competence The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne. —Geoffrey Chaucer If software architecture is worth doing, then surely it’s worth doing well. Most of the literature about architecture concentrates on the technical aspects. This is not surprising; it is a deeply technical discipline. But architectures are created by architects working in organizations that are full of actual human beings. Dealing with these humans is a decidedly nontechnical undertaking. What can be done to help architects, especially architects-in-training, be better at this important dimension of their job? And what can be done to help organizations do a better job of encouraging their architects to produce their best work? This chapter is about the competence of individual architects and the organizations that wish to produce high-quality architectures. Since the architecture competence of an organization depends, in part, on the competence of architects, we begin by asking what it is that architects are expected to do, know, and be skilled at. Then we’ll look at what organizations can and should do to help their architects produce better architectures. Individual and organizational competencies are intertwined. Understanding only one or the other won’t do.
