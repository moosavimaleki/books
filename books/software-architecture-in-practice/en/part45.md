![The structure of uses is displayed.](graphics/01fig06.jpg) Figure 1.6 Uses structure An illustration of the uses structure is presented. Nine different packages are shown in UML notation. They are estore.webapp, web::estore, admin.client, web::shared, web::accessControl, admin.core, estore.core, util, and dao. Each of the packages is connected and interconnected with each other using the <> attribute. The package web::estore is connected with static web artifacts. The package admin.client, admin.core, dao, and util are highlighted. *  Layer structure. The modules in this structure are called layers. A layer is an abstract “virtual machine” that provides a cohesive set of services through a managed interface. Layers are allowed to use other layers in a managed fashion; in strictly layered systems, a layer is only allowed to use a single other layer. This structure imbues a system with portability—that is, the ability to change the underlying virtual machine. [Figure 1.7](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig07) shows a layer structure of the UNIX System V operating system.
