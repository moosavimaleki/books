Why is this topic of interest and concern to architects? As an architect, you may be inclined—or indeed required—to use some form of virtualization to deploy the software that you create. For an increasingly large set of applications, you’ll be deploying to the cloud (coming up in [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17)) and using containers to do it. Furthermore, in cases where you will deploy to specialized hardware, virtualization allows you to perform testing in an environment that is much more accessible than the specialized hardware. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some of the most important terms, considerations, and tradeoffs in employing virtual resources. ### 16.1 Shared Resources For economic reasons, many organizations have adopted some forms of shared resources. These can dramatically lower the costs of deploying a system. There are four resources that we typically care about sharing: 1.  Central processor unit (CPU). Modern computers have multiple CPUs (and each CPU can have multiple processing cores). They may also have one or more graphics processing units (GPUs), or other special-purpose processors, such as a tensor processing unit (TPU).
