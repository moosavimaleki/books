#### Control Resource Demand One way to increase performance is to carefully manage the demand for resources. This can be done by reducing the number of events processed or by limiting the rate at which the system responds to events. In addition, a number of techniques can be applied to ensure that the resources that you do have are applied judiciously: *  Manage work requests. One way to reduce work is to reduce the number of requests coming into the system to do work. Ways to do that include the following: Manage event arrival. A common way to manage event arrivals from an external system is to put in place a service level agreement (SLA) that specifies the maximum event arrival rate that you are willing to support. An SLA is an agreement of the form “The system or component will process X events arriving per unit time with a response time of Y.” This agreement constrains both the system—it must provide that response—and the client—if it makes more than X requests per unit time, the response is not guaranteed. Thus, from the client’s perspective, if it needs more than X requests per unit time to be serviced, it must utilize multiple instances of the element processing the requests. SLAs are one method for managing scalability for Internet-based systems.
