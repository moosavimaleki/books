## 7 Integrability Integration is a basic law of life; when we resist it, disintegration is the natural result, both inside and outside of us. Thus we come to the concept of harmony through integration. —Norman Cousins According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the adjective integrable means “capable of being integrated.” We’ll give you a moment to catch your breath and absorb that profound insight. But for practical software systems, software architects need to be concerned about more than just making separately developed components cooperate; they are also concerned with the costs and technical risks of anticipated and (to varying degrees) unanticipated future integration tasks. These risks may be related to schedule, performance, or technology. A general, abstract representation of the integration problem is that a project needs to integrate a unit of software C, or a set of units C1, C2, … Cn, into a system S. S might be a platform, into which we integrate {Ci}, or it might be an existing system that already contains {C1, C2, …, Cn} and our task is to design for, and analyze the costs and technical risks of, integrating {Cn+1, … Cm}.
