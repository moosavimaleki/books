*  Availability of resources. Even in the absence of contention, computation cannot proceed if a resource is unavailable. Unavailability may be caused by the resource being offline or by failure of the component for any reason. *  Dependency on other computation. A computation may have to wait because it must synchronize with the results of another computation or because it is waiting for the results of a computation that it initiated. If a component calls another component and must wait for that component to respond, the time can be significant when the called component is at the other end of a network (as opposed to co-located on the same processor), or when the called component is heavily loaded. Whatever the cause, you must identify places in the architecture where resource limitations might cause a significant contribution to overall latency. With this background, we turn to our tactic categories. We can either reduce demand for resources (control resource demand) or make the resources we have available handle the demand more effectively (manage resources).
