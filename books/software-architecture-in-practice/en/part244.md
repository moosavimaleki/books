Intermediaries are often introduced during integration to resolve specific dependencies, but they can also be included in an architecture to promote integrability with respect to anticipated scenarios. Including a communication intermediary such as a publish–subscribe bus in an architecture, and then restricting communication paths to and from sensors to this bus, is an example of using an intermediary with the goal of promoting integrability of sensors. ##### Restrict Communication Paths This tactic restricts the set of elements with which a given element can communicate. In practice, this tactic is implemented by restricting an element’s visibility (when developers cannot see an interface, they cannot employ it) and by authorization (i.e., restricting access to only authorized elements). The restrict communication paths tactic is seen in service-oriented architectures (SOAs), in which point-to-point requests are discouraged in favor of forcing all requests to go through an enterprise service bus so that routing and preprocessing can be done consistently.
