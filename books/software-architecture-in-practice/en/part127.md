2.  If the answer in the “Supported” column is “Y,” then in the “Design Decisions and Location” column describe the specific design decisions made to support the tactic and enumerate where these decisions are, or will be, manifested (located) in the architecture. For example, indicate which code modules, frameworks, or packages implement this tactic. 3.  In the “Risk” column indicate the risk of implementing the tactic using a (H = High, M = Medium, L = Low) scale. 4.  In the “Rationale” column, describe the rationale for the design decisions made (including a decision to not use this tactic). Briefly explain the implications of this decision. For example, explain the rationale and implications of the decision in terms of the effort on cost, schedule, evolution, and so forth. While this questionnaire-based approach might sound simplistic, it can actually be very powerful and insightful. Addressing the set of questions forces the architect to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. This process can also be quite efficient: A typical questionnaire for a single quality attribute takes between 30 and 90 minutes to complete.
