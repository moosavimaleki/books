*  Shutting down functions depending on the mode of operations. Subsystems that are not being used can scale down their footprint, allowing competing subsystems to access more resources, and thereby deliver better performance. In sports cars, an example is switching on a “race mode,” which disables the processes responsible for calculating comfortable suspension parameters based on the road profile and activates calculations of torque distribution, braking power, suspension hardening, and centrifugal forces. *  Strategy for displaying information. This issue is tied to available display resolution. It’s possible to do GPS style mapping on a 320 × 320 pixel display, but a lot of effort has to go into minimizing the information on the display. At a resolution of 1,280 × 720, there are more pixels, so the information display can be richer. (Having the ability to change the information on the display is a strong motivator for a pattern such as MVC [see [Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#ch13)] so that the view can be swapped out based on the specific display characteristics.)
