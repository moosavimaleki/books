##### Abstract Common Services Where two elements provide services that are similar but not quite the same, it may be useful to hide both specific elements behind a common abstraction for a more general service. This abstraction might be realized as a common interface implemented by both, or it might involve an intermediary that translates requests for the abstract service to more specific requests for the elements hidden behind the abstraction. The resulting encapsulation hides the details of the elements from other components in the system. In terms of integrability, this means that future components can be integrated with a single abstraction rather than separately integrated with each of the specific elements. When the abstract common services tactic is combined with an intermediary (such as a wrapper or adapter), it can also normalize syntactic and semantic variations among the specific elements. For example, we see this when systems use many sensors of the same type from different manufacturers, each with its own device drivers, accuracy, or timing properties, but the architecture provides a common interface to them. As another example, your browser may accommodate various kinds of ad-blocking plug-ins, yet because of the plug-in interface the browser itself can remain blissfully unaware of your choice.
