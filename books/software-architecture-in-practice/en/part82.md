The slide showed, in semiformal box-and-line notation, what the major software elements were in a runtime view of the system. The names were all acronyms, suggesting no semantic meaning without explanation, which the young architect gave. The lines showed data flow, message passing, and process synchronization. The elements were internally redundant, as the architect was explaining. “In the event of a failure,” he began, using a laser pointer to denote one of the lines, “a restart mechanism triggers along this path when. . . .” “What happens when the mode select button is pushed?” interrupted one of the audience members. He was a government attendee representing the user community for this system. “Beg your pardon?” asked the architect. “The mode select button,” he said. “What happens when you push it?” “Um, that triggers an event in the device driver, up here,” began the architect, laser-pointing. “It then reads the register and interprets the event code. If it’s mode select, well, then, it signals the blackboard, which in turn signals the objects that have subscribed to that event. . . .”
