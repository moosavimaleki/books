*  Work assignment structure. This structure assigns responsibility for implementing and integrating the modules to the teams that will carry out these tasks. Having a work assignment structure be part of the architecture makes it clear that the decision about who does the work has architectural as well as management implications. The architect will know the expertise required on each team. Amazonâ€™s decision to devote a single team to each of its microservices, for example, is a statement about its work assignment structure. On large development projects, it is useful to identify units of functional commonality and assign those to a single team, rather than having them be implemented by everyone who needs them. This structure will also determine the major communication pathways among the teams: regular web conferences, wikis, email lists, and so forth. [Table 1.1](ch01.xhtml#ch01tab01) summarizes these structures. It lists the meaning of the elements and relations in each structure and tells what each might be used for.
