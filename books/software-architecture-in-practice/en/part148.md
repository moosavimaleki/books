*  Timeout is a tactic that raises an exception when a component detects that it or another component has failed to meet its timing constraints. For example, a component awaiting a response from another component can raise an exception if the wait time exceeds a certain value. *  Self-test. Components (or, more likely, whole subsystems) can run procedures to test themselves for correct operation. Self-test procedures can be initiated by the component itself or invoked from time to time by a system monitor. These may involve employing some of the techniques found in condition monitoring, such as checksums. #### Recover from Faults Recover from faults tactics are refined into preparation and repair tactics and reintroduction tactics. The latter are concerned with reintroducing a failed (but rehabilitated) component back into normal operation. Preparation and repair tactics are based on a variety of combinations of retrying a computation or introducing redundancy: *
