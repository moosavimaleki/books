The interactions between a server and its clients follow this sequence: *  Discovery: Communication is initiated by a client, which uses a discovery service to determine the location of the server. The server responds to the client using an agreed-upon protocol. *  Communication is initiated by a client, which uses a discovery service to determine the location of the server. *  The server responds to the client using an agreed-upon protocol. *  Interaction: The client sends requests to the server. The server processes the requests and responds. *  The client sends requests to the server. *  The server processes the requests and responds. Several points about this sequence are worth noting: *  The server may have multiple instances if the number of clients grows beyond the capacity of a single instance. *  If the server is stateless with respect to the clients, each request from a client is treated independently.
