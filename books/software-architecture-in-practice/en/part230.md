### 6.5 For Further Reading The first published set of energy tactics appeared in [[Procaccianti 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_213)]. These were, in part, the inspiration for the tactics presented here. The 2014 paper subsequently inspired [[Paradis 21](ref01.xhtml#ref_203)]. Many of the tactics presented in this chapter owe a debt to these two papers. For a good general introduction to energy usage in software development—and what developers do not know—you should read [[Pang 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_202)]. Several research papers have investigated the consequences of design choices on energy consumption, such as [[Kazman 18](ref01.xhtml#ref_143)] and [[Chowdhury 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_59)]. A general discussion of the importance of creating “energy-aware” software can be found in [[Fonseca 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_90)]. Energy patterns for mobile devices have been catalogued by [[Cruz 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_72)] and [[Schaarschmidt 20](ref01.xhtml#ref_219)]. ### 6.6 Discussion Questions 1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for energy efficiency using each of the possible responses in the general scenario. 2. Create a concrete energy efficiency scenario for a smartphone app (for example, a health monitoring app).
