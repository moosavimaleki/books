Keeping this emphasis in mind, I asked my clients to describe the quality attributes of concern for the system that I was analyzing. I’m sure you can imagine my surprise when security wasn’t mentioned once! The system stakeholders mentioned performance, modifiability, evolvability, interoperability, configurability, and portability, and one or two more, but the word “security” never passed their lips. Being a good analyst, I questioned this seemingly shocking and obvious omission. Their answer was simple and, in retrospect, straightforward: “We don’t care about it. Our systems are not connected to any external network, and we have barbed-wire fences and guards with machine guns.” Of course, someone at Livermore Labs was very interested in security. But not the software architects. The lesson here is that the software architect may not bear the responsibility for every QA requirement. —RK ### 3.4 Achieving Quality Attributes through Architectural Patterns and Tactics We now turn to the techniques an architect can use to achieve the required quality attributes: architectural patterns and tactics.
