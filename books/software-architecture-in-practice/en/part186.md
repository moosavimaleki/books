### 5.2 Deployability Deployability refers to a property of software indicating that it may be deployed—that is, allocated to an environment for execution—within a predictable and acceptable amount of time and effort. Moreover, if the new deployment is not meeting its specifications, it may be rolled back, again within a predictable and acceptable amount of time and effort. As the world moves increasingly toward virtualization and cloud infrastructures, and as the scale of deployed software-intensive systems inevitably increases, it is one of the architect’s responsibilities to ensure that deployment is done in an efficient and predictable way, minimizing overall system risk.[3](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn3a) [3](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn3). The quality attribute of testability (see [Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#ch12)) certainly plays a critical role in continuous deployment, and the architect can provide critical support for continuous deployment by ensuring that the system is testable, in all the ways just mentioned. However, our concern here is the quality attribute directly related to continuous deployment over and above testability: deployability.
