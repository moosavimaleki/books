A figure shows a data model along with the legend to interpret the data model. The legend is as follows. A table of three columns with a row header represents an entity. The first column contains the PK equals primary key, FK hash equals foreign key, and 1 hash equals index. The second column contains the column name (bold means required column). The third column contains the data type. A horizontal line with an arrowhead towards the left at the right end of the horizontal line is displayed. A small circle is shown attached before the arrowhead on the right end. Two small vertical lines are shown on the left end of the horizontal line. The letters A and B are shown on the left and right end of the horizontal line respectively. This representation defines the following: For each A, there are 0 or more B's; each B is related to exactly one A; A's PK is needed as a part of B's PK. The given data model shows three entities PurchaseOrder, OrderItem, and CatalogItem. For the entities PurchaseOrder and OrderItem, the entity PurchaseOrder acts as A, and the entity OrderItem acts as B. For the entities OrderItem and CatalogItem, the entity CatalogItem acts as A, and the entity OrderItem acts as B.
