### 14.4 For Further Reading The mother of all QA lists may be the one on—where else?—Wikipedia. This list can be found, naturally enough, under “List of system quality attributes.” As this book went to publication, you could gorge yourself on definitions of more than 80 distinct QAs. Our favorite is “demonstrability,” which is helpfully defined as the quality of being demonstrable. Who says you can’t believe what you read on the Internet? See [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08) of [[Bass 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_17)] to get a list of qualities of a deployment pipeline. These include traceability, testability (of the deployment pipeline), tooling, and cycle time. ### 14.5 Discussion Questions 1.
