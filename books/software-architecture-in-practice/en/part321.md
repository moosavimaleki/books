Deadline monotonic. Deadline monotonic is a static priority assignment that assigns a higher priority to streams with shorter deadlines. This scheduling policy is used when scheduling streams of different priorities with real-time deadlines. Rate monotonic. Rate monotonic is a static priority assignment for periodic streams that assigns a higher priority to streams with shorter periods. This scheduling policy is a special case of deadline monotonic, but is better known and more likely to be supported by the operating system. *  Semantic importance. Semantic importance assigns a priority statically according to some domain characteristic of the task that generates it. *  Deadline monotonic.
