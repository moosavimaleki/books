Volume, weight, and cost are constraints given both by the marketing department of an organization and by the physical considerations of its use. The marketing department is concerned with customers’ reactions. The physical considerations for the device’s use depend on both human and usage factors. Smartphone displays must be large enough for a human to read; automobiles are constrained by weight limits on roads; trains are constrained by track width; and so forth. Other constraints on mobile system resources (and therefore on software architects) reflect the following factors: *  Safety considerations. Physical resources that have safety consequences must not fail or must have backups. Backup processors, networks, or sensors add cost and weight, as well as consume space. For example, many aircraft have an emergency source of power that can be used in case of engine failure. *  Thermal limits. Heat can be generated by the system itself (think of your lap on which your laptop sits), which can have a detrimental effect on the system’s performance, even to the point of inducing failure. The environment’s ambient temperature—too high or too low—can have an impact as well. There should be an understanding of the environment in which the system will be operated prior to making hardware choices.
