The representation of the environment that is created and acted upon by a system is domain specific, as is the appropriate approach to degraded operation. We discussed security and privacy in detail in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08), but here we will focus on only the first concern: creating an accurate representation of the environment based on the data returned by the sensors. This is performed using the sensor stackâ€”a confederation of devices and software drivers that help turn raw data into interpreted information about the environment. Different platforms and domains tend to have their own sensor stacks, and sensor stacks often come with their own frameworks to help deal with the devices more easily. Over time, sensors are likely to encompass more and more functionality; in turn, the functions of a particular stack will change over time. Here, we enumerate some of the functions that must be achieved in the stack regardless of where a particular decomposition may have placed them:
