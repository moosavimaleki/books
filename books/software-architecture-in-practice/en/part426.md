The propagation cost coupling metric was first described in [[MacCormack 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_170)]. The decoupling level metric was described in [[Mo 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_181)]. Model checking is a technique that symbolically executes all possible code paths. The size of a system that can be validated using model checking is limited, but device drivers and microkernels have successfully been model checked. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking) for a list of model checking tools. ### 12.6 Discussion Questions 1. A testable system is one that gives up its faults easily. That is, if a system contains a fault, then it doesnâ€™t take long or much effort to make that fault show up. In contrast, fault tolerance is all about designing systems that jealously hide their faults; there, the whole idea is to make it very difficult for a system to reveal its faults. Is it possible to design a system that is both highly testable and highly fault tolerant, or are these two design goals inherently incompatible? Discuss.
