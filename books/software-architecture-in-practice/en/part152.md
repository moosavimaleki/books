*  Hitless in-service software upgrade (ISSU). This leverages the redundant spare tactic to achieve non-service-affecting upgrades to software and associated schema. *  Retry. The retry tactic assumes that the fault that caused a failure is transient, and that retrying the operation may lead to success. It is used in networks and in server farms where failures are expected and common. A limit should be placed on the number of retries that are attempted before a permanent failure is declared. *  Ignore faulty behavior. This tactic calls for ignoring messages sent from a particular source when we determine that those messages are spurious. For example, we would like to ignore the messages emanating from the live failure of a sensor. *  Graceful degradation. This tactic maintains the most critical system functions in the presence of component failures, while dropping less critical functions. This is done in circumstances where individual component failures gracefully reduce system functionality, rather than causing a complete system failure.
