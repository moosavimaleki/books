The remaining algorithms we discuss assume the existence of a mechanism for efficiently accessing the data manipulated by an algorithm, such as with QRAM. #### Matrix Inversion Matrix inversion underlies many problems in science. Machine learning, for example, requires the ability to invert large matrices. Quantum computers hold promise to speed up matrix inversion in this context. The HHL algorithm by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd will invert a linear matrix, subject to some constraints. The general problem is to solve the equation Ax = b, where A is an N × N matrix, x is a set of N unknowns, and b is a set of N known values. You learned about the simplest case (N = 2) in elementary algebra. As N grows, however, matrix inversion becomes the standard technique to solve the set of equations. The following constraints apply when solving this problem with quantum computers: 1.  The b’s must be quickly accessible. This is the problem that QRAM is supposed to solve.
