The tactics for deployability owe much to the work of Martin Fowler and his colleagues, which can be found in [[Fowler 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_92)], [[Lewis 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_165)], and [[Sato 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_218)]. Deployment pipelines are described in much more detail in [[Humble 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_119)] Microservices and the process of migrating to microservices are described in [[Newman 15](ref01.xhtml#ref_189)]. ### 5.8 Discussion Questions 1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for deployability using each of the possible responses in the general scenario. 2. Write a concrete deployability scenario for the software for a car (such as a Tesla). 3. Write a concrete deployability scenario for a smartphone app. Now write one for the server-side infrastructure that communicates with this app. 4. If you needed to display the results of a search operation, would you perform A/B testing or simply use the color that Google has chosen? Why? 5. Referring to the structures described in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01), which structures would be involved in implementing the package dependencies tactic? Would you use the uses structure? Why or why not? Are there other structures you would need to consider?
