At the end of step 6, the evaluation team should have a clear picture of the most important aspects of the entire architecture, the rationale for key design decisions, and a list of risks, non-risks, sensitivity points, and tradeoff points. At this point, phase 1 is concluded. ##### Hiatus and Start of Phase 2 The evaluation team summarizes what it has learned and interacts informally with the architect during a hiatus of a week or so. More scenarios might be analyzed during this period, if desired, or answers to questions posed in phase 1 may be clarified. Attendees at the phase 2 meeting include an expanded list of participants, with additional stakeholders joining the discussion. To use an analogy from programming: Phase 1 is akin to when you test your own program, using your own criteria. Phase 2 is when you give your program to an independent quality assurance group, who will likely subject your program to a wider variety of tests and environments.
