#### State Management in Distributed Systems State refers to information internal to a service that affects the computation of a response to a client request. State—or, more precisely, the collection of the values of the variables or data structures that store the state—depends on the history of requests to the service. Management of state becomes important when a service can process more than one client request at the same time, either because a service instance is multi-threaded, because there are multiple service instances behind a load balancer, or both. The key issue is where the state is stored. The three options are: 1.  The history maintained in each service instance, in which case the services are described as “stateful.” 2.  The history maintained in each client, in which case the services are described as “stateless.” 3.  The history persists outside the services and clients, in a database, in which case the services are described as “stateless.”
