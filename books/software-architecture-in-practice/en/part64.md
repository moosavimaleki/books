6.  Every process should be written so that its assignment to a specific processor can be easily changed, perhaps even at runtime. This is a driving force in the increasing trends toward virtualization and cloud deployment, as we will discuss in [Chapters 16](ch16.xhtml#ch16) and [17](ch17.xhtml#ch17). 7.  The architecture should feature a small number of simple component interaction patterns. That is, the system should do the same things in the same way throughout. This practice will aid in understandability, reduce development time, increase reliability, and enhance modifiability. 8.  The architecture should contain a specific (and small) set of resource contention areas, whose resolution is clearly specified and maintained. For example, if network utilization is an area of concern, the architect should produce (and enforce) for each development team guidelines that will result in acceptable levels of network traffic. If performance is a concern, the architect should produce (and enforce) time budgets.
