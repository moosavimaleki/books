*  This form of redundancy, which is applied to sensors, guards against the failure of a single sensor. *  Redundant sensors add cost to the system, and processing the inputs from multiple sensors is more complicated than processing the input from a single sensor. *  Monitor-actuator. This pattern focuses on two software elements—a monitor and an actuator controller—that are employed before sending a command to a physical actuator. The actuator controller performs the calculations necessary to determine the values to send to the physical actuator. The monitor checks these values for reasonableness before sending them. This separates the computation of the value from the testing of the value. Benefits: *  In this form of redundancy applied to actuator control, the monitor acts as a redundant check on the actuator controller computations. Tradeoffs: The development and maintenance of the monitor take time and resources. Because of the separation this pattern achieves between actuator control and monitoring, this particular tradeoff is easy to manipulate by making the monitor as simple (easy to produce but may miss errors) or as sophisticated (more complex but catches more errors) as required.
