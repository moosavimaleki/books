### 4.2 Tactics for Availability A failure occurs when the system no longer delivers a service that is consistent with its specification and this failure is observable by the systemâ€™s actors. A fault (or combination of faults) has the potential to cause a failure. Availability tactics, in turn, are designed to enable a system to prevent or endure system faults so that a service being delivered by the system remains compliant with its specification. The tactics we discuss in this section will keep faults from becoming failures or at least bound the effects of the fault and make repair possible, as illustrated in [Figure 4.2](ch04.xhtml#ch04fig02). ![The tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the fault. The response is the fault masked, prevented, or repair made.](graphics/04fig02.jpg) Figure 4.2 Goal of availability tactics Availability tactics have one of three purposes: fault detection, fault recovery, or fault prevention. The tactics for availability are shown in [Figure 4.3](ch04.xhtml#ch04fig03). These tactics will often be provided by a software infrastructure, such as a middleware package, so your job as an architect may be choosing and assessing (rather than implementing) the right availability tactics and the right combination of tactics.
