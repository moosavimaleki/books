The teleportation of the state of a qubit depends on entanglement. Recall that entanglement means that a measurement of one entangled qubit will guarantee that a measurement of the second qubit will have the same value. Teleportation utilizes three qubits. Qubit A and B are entangled, and then qubit ψ is entangled with qubit A. Qubit ψ is teleported to the location of qubit B, and its state becomes the state of qubit B. Roughly speaking, teleportation proceeds through these four steps: 1.  Entangle qubits A and B. We discussed what this means in the prior section. The locations of A and B can be physically separate. 2.  Prepare the “payload.” The payload qubit will have the state to be teleported. The payload, which is the qubit ψ, is prepared at the location of A. 3.  Propagate the payload. The propagation involves two classical bits that are transferred to the location of B. The propagation also involves measuring A and ψ, which destroys the state of both of these qubits.
