*  Which stakeholders will participate? The evaluation process should include a method to elicit the important stakeholdersâ€™ goals and concerns regarding the system. At this stage, it is critical to identify the individuals who are needed and ensure their participation in the evaluation. *  What are the business goals? The evaluation should answer whether the system will satisfy the business goals. If the business goals are not explicitly captured and prioritized prior to the evaluation, then a portion of the evaluation should be dedicated to this task. Evaluations by peers and by outside evaluators are common enough that we have formalized processes to guide the evaluation. These processes define who should participate and which activities should occur during the evaluation. Formalizing a process enables the organization to make the process more repeatable, help the stakeholders understand what will be required and delivered by the evaluation, train new evaluators to use the process, and understand the investment required to perform the evaluation.
