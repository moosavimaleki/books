Table 10.2 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Safety Tactics Group Tactics Question Supported? (Y/N) Risk Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Unsafe State Avoidance Do you employ substitution—that is, safer, often hardware-based protection mechanisms for potentially dangerous software design features? Do you use a predictive model to predict the state of health of system processes, resources, or other properties—based on monitored information—not only to ensure that the system is operating within its nominal operating parameters, but also to provide early warning of a potential problem? Unsafe State Detection Do you use timeouts to determine whether the operation of a component meets its timing constraints? Do you use timestamps to detect incorrect sequences of events? Do you employ condition monitoring to check conditions in a process or device, particularly to validate assumptions made during design? Is sanity checking employed to check the validity or reasonableness of specific operation results, or inputs or outputs of a component?
