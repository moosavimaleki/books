Encapsulation may also hide interfaces that are not relevant for a particular integration task. An example is a library used by a service that can be completely hidden from all consumers and changed without these changes propagating to the consumers. Encapsulation, then, can reduce the number of dependencies as well as the syntactic, data, and behavior semantic distances between C and S. ##### Use an Intermediary Intermediaries are used for breaking dependencies between a set of components Ci or between Ci and the system S. Intermediaries can be used to resolve different types of dependencies. For example, intermediaries such as a publishâ€“subscribe bus, shared data repository, or dynamic service discovery all reduce dependencies between data producers and consumers by removing any need for either to know the identity of the other party. Other intermediaries, such as data transformers and protocol translators, resolve forms of syntactic and data semantic distance. Determining the specific benefits of a particular intermediary requires knowledge of what the intermediary actually does. An analyst needs to determine whether the intermediary reduces the number of dependencies between a component and the system and which dimensions of distance, if any, it addresses.
