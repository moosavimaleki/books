Groverâ€™s algorithm is an example of a probabilistic algorithm that computes the inverse of a function. It takes on the order of 2128 iterations to calculate the inverse of a hash based on 256 bits. This represents a quadratic speedup over conventional computational algorithms, meaning that the quantum algorithm time is approximately the square root of the conventional algorithm time. This makes an enormous amount of password-protected material, previously thought to be secure, quite vulnerable. Modern secure encryption algorithms are based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Let p and q be two distinct primes each greater than 128 bits in magnitude. The product of these two primes pq is roughly 256 bits in magnitude. This product is relatively easy to compute given p and q. However, factoring the product, pq, and recovering p and q is computationally very difficult on a classical computer: It is in the category NP-hard.
