At both the low end and the high end, energy consumption of computational devices has become an issue that we should consider. This means that we, as architects, now need to add energy efficiency to the long list of competing qualities that we consider when designing a system. And, as with every other quality attribute, there are nontrivial tradeoffs to consider: energy usage versus performance or availability or modifiability or time to market. Thus considering energy efficiency as a first-class quality attribute is important for the following reasons: 1.  An architectural approach is necessary to gain control over any important system quality attribute, and energy efficiency is no different. If system-wide techniques for monitoring and managing energy are lacking, then developers are left to invent them on their own. This will, in the best case, result in an ad hoc approach to energy efficiency that produces a system that is hard to maintain, measure, and evolve. In the worst case, it will yield an approach that simply does not predictably achieve the desired energy efficiency goals.
