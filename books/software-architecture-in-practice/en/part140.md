![A flowchart of the availability tactics.](graphics/04fig03.jpg) Figure 4.3 Availability tactics The availability tactics are depicted as a chart. The availability tactics are divided into detect faults, recover from faults, and prevent faults. The detect faults list the following: monitor, ping/echo, heartbeat, timestamp, condition monitoring, sanity checking, voting, exception detection, and self-test. The recover form faults is divided into preparation and repair and reintroduction. The preparation and repair list the following: redundant spare, rollback, exception handling, software upgrade, retry, ignore faulty behavior, graceful degradation, and reconfiguration. The reintroduction lists the following: shadow, state resynchronization, escalating restart, and nonstop forwarding. The prevent faults list the following: removal from service, transactions, predictive model, exception prevention, and increase competence test. #### Detect Faults Before any system can take action regarding a fault, the presence of the fault must be detected or anticipated. Tactics in this category include: *  Monitor. This component is used to monitor the state of health of various other parts of the system: processors, processes, I/O, memory, and so forth. A system monitor can detect failure or congestion in the network or other shared resources, such as from a denial-of-service attack. It orchestrates software using other tactics in this category to detect malfunctioning components. For example, the system monitor can initiate self-tests, or be the component that detects faulty timestamps or missed heartbeats.[1](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn1a)
