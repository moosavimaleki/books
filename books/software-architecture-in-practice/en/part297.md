Performance is often linked to scalability—that is, increasing your system’s capacity for work, while still performing well. They’re certainly linked, although technically scalability is making your system easy to change in a particular way, and so is a kind of modifiability, as discussed in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08). In addition, scalability of services in the cloud is discussed explicitly in [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17). Often, performance improvement happens after you have constructed a version of your system and found its performance to be inadequate. You can anticipate this by architecting your system with performance in mind. For example, if you have designed the system with a scalable resource pool, and you subsequently determine that this pool is a bottleneck (from your instrumented data), then you can easily increase the size of the pool. If not, your options are limited—and mostly all bad—and they may involve considerable rework. It is not useful to spend a lot of your time optimizing a portion of the system that is responsible for only a small percentage of the total time. Instrumenting the system by logging timing information will help you determine where the actual time is spent and allow you to focus on improving the performance of critical portions of the system.
