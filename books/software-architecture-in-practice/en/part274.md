Now we can understand tactics and their consequences as affecting one or more of these parameters: reducing size, increasing cohesion, reducing coupling, and deferring binding time. These tactics are shown in [Figure 8.3](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig03). ![A flowchart of the modifiability tactics.](graphics/08fig03.jpg) Figure 8.3 Modifiability tactics The modifiability tactics is depicted as a chart. The modifiability tactics is divided into increase cohesion, reduce coupling, and defer binding. The increase cohesion lists the following: split module and redistribute responsibilities. The reduce coupling lists the following: encapsulate, use an intermediary, abstract common services, and restrict dependencies. The defer binding lists the following: component replacement, couple-time parameterization, aspects, configuration-time binding, resource files, discovery, interpret parameters, shared repositories, and polymorphism. #### Increase Cohesion Several tactics involve redistributing responsibilities among modules. This step is taken to reduce the likelihood that a single change will affect multiple modules. *  Split module. If the module being modified includes responsibilities that are not cohesive, the modification costs will likely be high. Refactoring the module into several more cohesive modules should reduce the average cost of future changes. Splitting a module should not simply consist of placing half of the lines of code into each submodule; instead, it should sensibly and appropriately result in a series of submodules that are cohesive on their own.
