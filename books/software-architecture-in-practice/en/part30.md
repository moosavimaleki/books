[1](ch01.xhtml#ch01fn1). In this book, we use the term “element” when we mean either a module or a component, and don’t want to distinguish between the two. #### Architecture versus Design Architecture is design, but not all design is architecture. That is, many design decisions are left unbound by the architecture—it is, after all, an abstraction—and depend on the discretion and good judgment of downstream designers and even implementers. #### Every Software System Has a Software Architecture Every system has an architecture, because every system has elements and relations. However, it does not follow that the architecture is known to anyone. Perhaps all of the people who designed the system are long gone, the documentation has vanished (or was never produced), the source code has been lost (or was never delivered), and all we have at hand is the executing binary code. This reveals the difference between the architecture of a system and the representation of that architecture. Given that an architecture can exist independently of its description or specification, this raises the importance of architecture documentation, which is described in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22).
