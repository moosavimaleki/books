[5](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn5). Canary testing is named after the 19th-century practice of bringing canaries into coal mines. Coal mining releases gases that are explosive and poisonous. Because canaries are more sensitive to these gases than humans, coal miners brought canaries into the mines and watched them for signs of reaction to the gases. The canaries acted as early warning devices for the miners, indicating an unsafe environment. In both cases, the users are designated as canaries and routed to the appropriate version of a service through DNS settings or through discovery-service configuration. After testing is complete, users are all directed to either the new version or the old version, and instances of the deprecated version are destroyed. Rolling upgrade or blue/green deployment could be used to deploy the new version. Benefits: *  Canary testing allows real users to “bang on” the software in ways that simulated testing cannot. This allows the organization deploying the service to collect “in use” data and perform controlled experiments with relatively low risk.
