This sharing of the operating system represents a source of performance improvement when transferring images. As long as the target machine has a standard container runtime engine running on it (and these days all container runtime engines are built to standards), there is no need to transfer the operating system as part of the container image. The second source of performance improvement is the use of “layers” in the container images. (Note that container layers are different from the notion of layers in module structures that we introduced in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01).) To better understand container layers, we will describe how a container image is constructed. In this case, we will illustrate the construction of a container to run the LAMP stack, and we will build the image in layers. (LAMP—which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP—is a widely used stack for constructing web applications.) The process of building an image using the LAMP stack is as follows:
