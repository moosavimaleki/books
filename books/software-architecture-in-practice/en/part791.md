[Figure 23.1](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig01) shows 11 of the files from the Apache Camel project—an open source integration framework—and their structural dependencies (indicated by the labels “dp,” “im,” and “ex” for dependency, implementation, and extension, respectively). For example, the file on row 9 of [Figure 23.1](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig01), MethodCallExpression.java, depends on and extends the file on column 1, ExpressionDefinition.java, and the file on row 11, AssertionClause.java, depends on the file on column 10, MockEndpoint.java. These static dependencies are extracted by reverse-engineering the source code. ![The structural dependencies of the Apache Camel are presented.](graphics/23fig01.jpg) Figure 23.1 A DSM of Apache Camel showing structural dependencies An illustration shows the DSM of Apache camel that shows the structural dependencies. A 32 by 32 matrix is displayed. The rows of the matrix represent different java extension files. The column represents the numbers from 1 to 32. The diagonal of the matrix shows numbers from 1 to 32 along with the dependencies. Wherever the dependencies exist, it is marked as dp in the matrix.
