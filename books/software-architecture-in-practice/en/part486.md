Tiered system architecture. The “server” can be broken into multiple independent elements, which may be deployed independently. For example, the business logic and the database can be deployed independently. Code on demand (optional). It is possible for the server to provide code to the client to be executed. JavaScript is an example. *  Uniform interface. All interactions use the same form (typically HTTP). Resources on the providing side of the interface are specified via URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Naming conventions should be consistent and, in general, the principle of least surprise should be followed. *  Client-server. The actors are clients and the resource providers are servers using the client-server pattern. *  Stateless. All client-server interactions are stateless. That is, the client should not assume that the server has retained any information about the client’s last request. In consequence, interactions such as authorization are encoded into a token and the token is passed with each request.
