Module views are excellent means of showing someone the structure of a project: who does what, which teams are assigned to which parts of the system, and so forth. Component-and-connector views are excellent choices for explaining how the system is expected to work and accomplish its job. Allocation views show a new project member where their assigned part fits into the project’s development or deployment environment. ### 2.14 Summary Software architecture is important for a wide variety of technical and nontechnical reasons. Our List of Thirteen includes the following benefits: 1.  An architecture will inhibit or enable a system’s driving quality attributes. 2.  The decisions made in an architecture allow you to reason about and manage change as the system evolves. 3.  The analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s qualities. 4.  A documented architecture enhances communication among stakeholders. 5.  The architecture is a carrier of the earliest, and hence most-fundamental, hardest-to-change design decisions.
