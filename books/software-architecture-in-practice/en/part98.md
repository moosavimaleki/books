*  Easier analysis with greater confidence *  Shorter selection time *  Greater interoperability Unprecedented designs are risky. Proven designs are, well, proven. This is not to say that software design can never be innovative or offer new and exciting solutions. It can. But these solutions should not be invented for the sake of novelty; rather, they should be sought when existing solutions are insufficient to solve the problem at hand. Properties of software follow from the choice of architectural tactics or patterns. Tactics and patterns that are more desirable for a particular problem should improve the resulting design solution, perhaps by making it easier to arbitrate conflicting design constraints, by increasing insights into poorly understood design contexts, and by helping surface inconsistencies in requirements. We will discuss architectural tactics and patterns in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02). ### 2.13 A Basis for Training The architecture, including a description of how the elements interact with each other to carry out the required behavior, can serve as the first introduction to the system for new project members. This reinforces our point that one important use of software architecture is to support and encourage communication among the various stakeholders. The architecture serves as a common reference point for all of these people.
