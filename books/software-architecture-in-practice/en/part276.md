*  Use an intermediary. See the discussion in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07). *  Abstract common services. See the discussion in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07). *  Restrict dependencies. This tactic restricts which modules a given module interacts with or depends on. In practice, this tactic is implemented by restricting a moduleâ€™s visibility (when developers cannot see an interface, they cannot employ it) and by authorization (restricting access to only authorized modules). The restrict dependencies tactic is seen in layered architectures, in which a layer is allowed to use only lower layers (sometimes only the next lower layer), and with the use of wrappers, where external entities can see (and hence depend on) only the wrapper, and not the internal functionality that it wraps. #### Defer Binding Because the work of people is almost always more expensive error-prone than the work of computers, letting computers handle a change as much as possible will almost always reduce the cost of making that change. If we design artifacts with built-in flexibility, then exercising that flexibility is usually cheaper than hand-coding a specific change.
