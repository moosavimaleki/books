Benefits: *  Services are designed to be used by a variety of clients, leading them to be more generic. Many commercial organizations will provide and market their service with the goal of broad adoption. *  Services are independent. The only method for accessing a service is through its interface and through messages over a network. Consequently, a service and the rest of the system do not interact, except through their interfaces. *  Services can be implemented heterogeneously, using whatever languages and technologies are most appropriate. Tradeoffs: *  SOAs, because of their heterogeneity and distinct ownership, come with a great many interoperability features such as WSDL and SOAP. This adds complexity and overhead. #### Dynamic Discovery Dynamic discovery applies the discover tactic to enable the discovery of service providers at runtime. Consequently, a runtime binding can occur between a service consumer and a concrete service. Use of a dynamic discovery capability sets the expectation that the system will clearly advertise both the services available for integration with future components and the minimal information that will be available for each service. The specific information available will vary, but typically comprises data that can be mechanically searched during discovery and runtime integration (e.g., identifying a specific version of an interface standard by string match).
