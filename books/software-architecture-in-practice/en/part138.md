Time or time interval in which system can be in degraded mode *  Proportion (e.g., 99 percent) or rate (e.g., up to 100 per second) of a certain class of faults that the system prevents, or handles without failing Response measure We may focus on a number of measures of availability, depending on the criticality of the service being provided. An example concrete availability scenario derived from the general scenario in [Table 4.2](ch04.xhtml#ch04tab02) is shown in [Figure 4.1](ch04.xhtml#ch04fig01). The scenario is this: A server in a server farm fails during normal operation, and the system informs the operator and continues to operate with no downtime. ![A sample concrete availability scenario is presented.](graphics/04fig01.jpg) Figure 4.1 Sample concrete availability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a server in a server farm. The stimulus is server fails. The artifact is the server. The environment is a normal operation. The response is the system informs the operator and the system continues to operate. The response measure is no downtime.
