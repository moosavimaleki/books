*  If your system must be highly secure, then you need to manage and protect interelement communication and control which elements are allowed to access which information. You may also need to introduce specialized elements (such as an authorization mechanism) into the architecture to set up a strong “perimeter” to guard against intrusion. *  If you want your system to be safe and secure, you need to design in safeguards and recovery mechanisms. *  If you believe that scalability of performance will be important to the success of your system, then you need to localize the use of resources to facilitate the introduction of higher-capacity replacements, and you must avoid hard-coding in resource assumptions or limits. *  If your projects need the ability to deliver incremental subsets of the system, then you must manage intercomponent usage. *  If you want the elements from your system to be reusable in other systems, then you need to restrict interelement coupling so that when you extract an element, it does not come out with too many attachments to its current environment to be useful.
