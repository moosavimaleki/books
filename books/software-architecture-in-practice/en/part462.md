Searching for publications and blog posts on this QA and attempting to generalize their observations and findings. Finding experts in this area and interviewing them or simply writing and asking them for advice. *  Revisiting a body of mechanisms you’re familiar with and asking yourself how each one affects the QA parameter. *  Searching for designs that have successfully dealt with this QA. You can search on the name you’ve given the QA itself, but you can also search for the terms you chose when you refined the QA into subattributes. *  Searching for publications and blog posts on this QA and attempting to generalize their observations and findings. *  Finding experts in this area and interviewing them or simply writing and asking them for advice. What results is a list of mechanisms to, in the example case, control performance and, in the more general case, to control the QA that the model is concerned with. This makes the design problem much more tractable. This list of mechanisms is finite and reasonably small, because the number of parameters of the model is bounded and for each parameter, the number of architectural decisions to affect the parameter is limited.
