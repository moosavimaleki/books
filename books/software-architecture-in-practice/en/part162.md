Recover from Faults (Reintroduction) Can the system operate a previously failed or in-service upgraded component in a “shadow mode” for a predefined time prior to reverting the component back to an active role? If the system uses active or passive redundancy, does it also employ state resynchronization to send state information from active components to standby components? Does the system employ escalating restart to recover from faults by varying the granularity of the component(s) restarted and minimizing the level of service affected? Can message processing and routing portions of the system employ nonstop forwarding, where functionality is split into supervisory and data planes? Prevent Faults Can the system remove components from service, temporarily placing a system component in an out-of-service state for the purpose of preempting potential system failures? Does the system employ transactions—bundling state updates so that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable?
