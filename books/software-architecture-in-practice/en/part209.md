*  Canary testing incurs minimal additional development costs, because the system being tested is on a path to production anyway. *  Canary testing minimizes the number of users who may be exposed to a serious defect in the new system. Tradeoffs: *  Canary testing requires additional up-front planning and resources, and a strategy for evaluating the results of the tests needs to be formulated. *  If canary testing is aimed at power users, those users have to be identified and the new version routed to them. ##### A/B Testing A/B testing is used by marketers to perform an experiment with real users to determine which of several alternatives yields the best business results. A small but meaningful number of users receive a different treatment from the remainder of the users. The difference can be minor, such as a change to the font size or form layout, or it can be more significant. For example, HomeAway (now Vrbo) has used A/B testing to vary the format, content, and look-and-feel of its worldwide websites, tracking which editions produced the most rentals. The “winner” would be kept, the “loser” discarded, and another contender designed and deployed. Another example is a bank offering different promotions to open new accounts. An oft-repeated story is that Google tested 41 different shades of blue to decide which shade to use to report search results.
