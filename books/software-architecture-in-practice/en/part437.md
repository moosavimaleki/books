*  Maintain task model. The task model is used to determine context so the system can have some idea of what the user is attempting to do and provide assistance. For example, many search engines provide predictive type-ahead capabilities, and many mail clients provide spell-correction. Both of these functions are based on task models. *  Maintain user model. This model explicitly represents the user’s knowledge of the system, the user’s behavior in terms of expected response time, and other aspects specific to a user or a class of users. For example, language-learning apps are constantly monitoring areas where a user makes mistakes and then providing additional exercises to correct those behaviors. A special case of this tactic is commonly found in user interface customization, wherein a user can explicitly modify the system’s user model. *  Maintain system model. The system maintains an explicit model of itself. This is used to determine expected system behavior so that appropriate feedback can be given to the user. A common manifestation of a system model is a progress bar that predicts the time needed to complete the current activity.
