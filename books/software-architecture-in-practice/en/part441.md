Benefits: *  Because MVC promotes clear separation of concerns, changes to one aspect of the system, such as the layout of the UI (the view), often have no consequences for the model or the controller. *  Additionally, because MVC promotes separation of concerns, developers can be working on all aspects of the pattern—model, view, and controller—relatively independently and in parallel. These separate aspects can also be tested in parallel. *  A model can be used in systems with different views, or a view might be used in systems with different models. Tradeoffs: *  MVC can become burdensome for complex UIs, as information is often sprinkled throughout several components. For example, if there are multiple views of the same model, a change to the model may require changes to several otherwise unrelated components. *  For simple UIs, MVC adds up-front complexity that may not pay off in downstream savings. *  MVC adds a small amount of latency to user interactions. While this is generally acceptable, it might be problematic for applications that require very low latency.
