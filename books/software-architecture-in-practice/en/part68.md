A number of books have focused on practical implementation issues associated with architectures, such as George Fairbanks’ Just Enough Software Architecture [[Fairbanks 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_85)], Woods and Rozanski’s Software Systems Architecture [[Woods 11](ref01.xhtml#ref_255)], and Martin’s Clean Architecture: A Craftsman’s Guide to Software Structure and Design [[Martin 17](ref01.xhtml#ref_174)]. ### 1.6 Discussion Questions 1. Is there a different definition of software architecture that you are familiar with? If so, compare and contrast it with the definition given in this chapter. Many definitions include considerations like “rationale” (stating the reasons why the architecture is what it is) or how the architecture will evolve over time. Do you agree or disagree that these considerations should be part of the definition of software architecture? 2. Discuss how an architecture serves as a basis for analysis. What about decision making? What kinds of decision making does an architecture empower? 3. What is architecture’s role in project risk reduction?
