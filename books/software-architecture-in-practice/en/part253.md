Does the system broadly use intermediaries for breaking dependencies between components—for example, removing a data producer’s knowledge of its consumers? Does the system abstract common services, providing a general, abstract interface for similar services? Does the system provide a means to restrict communication paths between components? Does the system adhere to standards in terms of how components interact and share information with each other? Adapt Does the system provide the ability to statically (i.e., at compile time) tailor interfaces—that is, the ability to add or hide capabilities of a component’s interface without changing its API or implementation? Does the system provide a discovery service, cataloguing and disseminating information about services? Does the system provide a means to configure the behavior of components at build, initialization, or runtime? Coordinate Does the system include an orchestration mechanism that coordinates and manages the invocation of components so they can remain unaware of each other?
