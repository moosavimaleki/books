Letâ€™s consider some examples: *  Manage event rate. Lights on highway entrance ramps let cars onto the highway only at set intervals, and cars must wait (queue) on the ramp for their turn. *  Prioritize events. Ambulances and police, with their lights and sirens going, have higher priority than ordinary citizens; some highways have high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, giving priority to vehicles with two or more occupants. *  Maintain multiple copies. Add traffic lanes to existing roads or build parallel routes. In addition, users of the system can employ their own tricks: *  Increase resources. Buy a Ferrari, for example. All other things being equal, being the fastest car with a competent driver on an open road will get you to your destination more quickly. *  Increase efficiency. Find a new route that is quicker and/or shorter than your current route. *  Reduce computational overhead. Drive closer to the car in front of you, or load more people into the same vehicle (i.e., carpooling).
