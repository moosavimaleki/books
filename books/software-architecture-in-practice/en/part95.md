Product lines represent a powerful approach to multi-system development that has shown order-of-magnitude payoffs in time to market, cost, productivity, and product quality. The power of architecture lies at the heart of this paradigm. Similar to other capital investments, architectures for product lines become a developing organizationâ€™s shared asset. ### 2.11 Architecture Allows Incorporation of Independently Developed Elements Whereas earlier software paradigms focused on programming as the prime activity, with progress measured in lines of code, architecture-based development often focuses on composing or assembling elements that are likely to have been developed separately, even independently, from each other. This composition is possible because the architecture defines the elements that can be incorporated into the system. The architecture constrains possible replacements (or additions) according to how they interact with their environment, how they receive and relinquish control, which data they consume and produce, how they access data, and which protocols they use for communication and resource sharing. We elaborate on these ideas in [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15).
