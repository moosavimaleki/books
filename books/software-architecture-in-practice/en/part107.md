Although responsibilities can be allocated arbitrarily to any module, software architecture constrains this allocation when other quality attributes are important. For example, systems are frequently (or perhaps always) divided so that several people can cooperatively build them. The architect’s interest in functionality is how it interacts with and constrains other qualities. # Functional Requirements After more than 30 years of writing about and discussing the distinction between functional requirements and quality requirements, the definition of functional requirements still eludes me. Quality attribute requirements are well defined: Performance has to do with the system’s timing behavior, modifiability has to do with the system’s ability to support changes in its behavior or other qualities after initial deployment, availability has to do with the system’s ability to survive failures, and so forth. Function, however, is a much more slippery concept. An international standard (ISO 25010) defines functional suitability as “the capability of the software product to provide functions which meet stated and implied needs when the software is used under specified conditions.” That is, functionality is the ability to provide functions. One interpretation of this definition is that functionality describes what the system does and quality describes how well the system does its function. That is, qualities are attributes of the system and function is the purpose of the system.
