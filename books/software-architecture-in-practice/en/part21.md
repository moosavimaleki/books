Finally, we are building different kinds of systems, and building them in different ways than a decade ago. Systems these days are often built on top of virtualized resources that reside in a cloud, and they need to provide and depend on explicit interfaces. Also, they are increasingly mobile, with all of the opportunities and challenges that mobility brings. So, in this edition we have added chapters on virtualization, interfaces, mobility, and the cloud. As you can see, we convinced ourselves. We hope that we have convinced you as well, and that you will find this fourth edition a useful addition to your (physical or electronic) bookshelf.
