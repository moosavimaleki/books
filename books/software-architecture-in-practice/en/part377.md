Achieving privacy is about limiting access to information, which in turn is about which information should be access-limited and to whom access should be allowed. The general term for information that should be kept private is personally identifiable information (PII). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines PII as “any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.” The question of who is permitted access to such data is more complicated. Users are routinely asked to review and agree to privacy agreements initiated by organizations. These privacy agreements detail who, outside of the collecting organization, is entitled to see PII. The collecting organization itself should have policies that govern who within that organization can have access to such data. Consider, for example, a tester for a software system. To perform tests, realistic data should be used. Does that data include PII? Generally, PII is obscured for testing purposes.
