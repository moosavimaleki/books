Temporal inconsistency. In a sequence of requests by Client C to Service A, some may be served by the old version of the service and some may be served by the new version. If the versions behave differently, this may cause Client C to produce erroneous, or at least inconsistent, results. (This can be prevented by using the manage service interactions tactic.) Interface mismatch. If the interface to the new version of Service A is different from the interface to the old version of Service A, then invocations by clients of Service A that have not been updated to reflect the new interface will produce unpredictable results. This can be prevented by extending the interface but not modifying the existing interface, and using the mediator pattern (see [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07)) to translate from the extended interface to an internal interface that produces correct behavior. See [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15) for a fuller discussion.
