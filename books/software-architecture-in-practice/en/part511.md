![An illustration of a hosted hypervisor.](graphics/16fig02.jpg) Figure 16.2 Hosted hypervisor A figure shows the structure of a hosted hypervisor. A host computer is shown in a large block. The virtual machines VM1, VM2, and two other applications are shown inside the host computer. The operating system is shown inside the host computer at the bottom. A hypervisor requires that its guest VMs use the same instruction set as the underlying physical CPUâ€”the hypervisor does not translate or simulate instruction execution. For example, if you have a VM for a mobile or embedded device that uses an ARM processor, you cannot run that virtual machine on a hypervisor that uses an x86 processor. Another technology, related to hypervisors, supports cross-processor execution; it is called an emulator. An emulator reads the binary code for the target or guest processor and simulates the execution of guest instructions on the host processor. The emulator often also simulates guest I/O hardware devices. For example, the open source QEMU emulator[1](ch16.xhtml#ch16fn1a) can emulate a full PC system, including BIOS, x86 processor and memory, sound card, graphics card, and even a floppy disk drive.
