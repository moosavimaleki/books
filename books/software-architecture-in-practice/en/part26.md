These, then, are the topics for this book: the design, analysis, and documentation of architectures. We will also examine the influences, principally in the form of business goals that lead to quality attribute requirements, that inform these activities. In this chapter, we will focus on architecture strictly from a software engineering point of view. That is, we will explore the value that a software architecture brings to a development project. Later chapters will take business and organizational perspectives. ### 1.1 What Software Architecture Is and What It Isn’t There are many definitions of software architecture, easily discoverable with a web search, but the one we like is this: The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. This definition stands in contrast to other definitions that talk about the system’s “early” or “major” or “important” decisions. While it is true that many architectural decisions are made early, not all are—especially in Agile and spiral-development projects. It’s also true that many decisions that are made early are not what we would consider architectural. Also, it’s hard to look at a decision and tell whether it’s “major.” Sometimes only time will tell. And since deciding on an architecture is one of the architect’s most important obligations, we need to know which decisions an architecture comprises.
