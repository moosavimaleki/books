*  the user is concerned that the system is fast, reliable, and available when needed; *  the customer (who pays for the system) is concerned that the architecture can be implemented on schedule and according to budget; *  the manager is worried that (in addition to cost and schedule concerns) the architecture will allow teams to work largely independently, interacting in disciplined and controlled ways; and *  the architect is worried about strategies to achieve all of those goals. Architecture provides a common language in which different concerns can be expressed, negotiated, and resolved at a level that is intellectually manageable even for large, complex systems. Without such a language, it is difficult to understand large systems sufficiently to make the early decisions that influence both quality and usefulness. Architectural analysis, as we will see in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21), both depends on this level of communication and enhances it. [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22), on architecture documentation, covers stakeholders and their concerns in greater depth.
