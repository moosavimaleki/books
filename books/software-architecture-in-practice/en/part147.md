Timeout is a tactic that raises an exception when a component detects that it or another component has failed to meet its timing constraints. For example, a component awaiting a response from another component can raise an exception if the wait time exceeds a certain value. *  System exceptions will vary according to the processor hardware architecture employed. They include faults such as divide by zero, bus and address faults, illegal program instructions, and so forth. *  The parameter fence tactic incorporates a known data pattern (such as 0xDEADBEEF) placed immediately after any variable-length parameters of an object. This allows for runtime detection of overwriting the memory allocated for the object’s variable-length parameters. *  Parameter typing employs a base class that defines functions that add, find, and iterate over type-length-value (TLV) formatted message parameters. Derived classes use the base class functions to provide functions to build and parse messages. Use of parameter typing ensures that the sender and the receiver of messages agree on the type of the content, and detects cases where they don’t.
