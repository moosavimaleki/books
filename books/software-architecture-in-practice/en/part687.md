2.  Articulation of the business goals. Frequently, the business goals presented in the ATAM exercise are being seen by some of the assembled participants for the first time and these are captured in the outputs. This description of the business goals survives the evaluation and becomes part of the projectâ€™s legacy. 3.  Prioritized quality attribute requirements expressed as quality attribute scenarios. These quality attribute scenarios take the form described in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03). The ATAM uses prioritized quality attribute scenarios as the basis for evaluating the architecture. Those scenarios may already exist (perhaps as a result of a prior requirements-capture exercise or ADD activity), but if not, they are generated by the participants as part of the ATAM exercise. 4.  A set of risks and non-risks. An architectural risk is a decision that may lead to undesirable consequences in light of stated quality attribute requirements. Similarly, an architectural non-risk is a decision that, upon analysis, is deemed safe. The identified risks form the basis for an architectural risk mitigation plan. These risks are the primary output of an ATAM exercise.
