With all of these concerns, the architect must be able to assess the associated risks. Architects are primarily concerned with the degree to which the architecture supports deployments that are: *  Granular. Deployments can be of the whole system or of elements within a system. If the architecture provides options for finer granularity of deployment, then certain risks can be reduced. *  Controllable. The architecture should provide the capability to deploy at varying levels of granularity, monitor the operation of the deployed units, and roll back unsuccessful deployments. *  Efficient. The architecture should support rapid deployment (and, if needed, rollback) with a reasonable level of effort. These characteristics will be reflected in the response measures of the general scenario for deployability. ### 5.3 Deployability General Scenario [Table 5.1](ch05.xhtml#ch05tab01) enumerates the elements of the general scenario that characterize deployability.
