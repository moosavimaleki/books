Table 21.2 ATAM Phases and Their Characteristics Phase Activity Participants Typical Cumulative Time 0 Partnership and preparation Evaluation team leadership and key project decision makers Proceeds informally as required, perhaps over a few weeks 1 Evaluation Evaluation team and project decision makers 1–2 days 2 Evaluation (continued) Evaluation team, project decision makers, and stakeholders 2 days 3 Follow-up Evaluation team and evaluation client 1 week Source: Adapted from [[Clements 01b](ref01.xhtml#ref_61)]. #### Steps of the Evaluation Phases The ATAM analysis phases (phases 1 and 2) consist of nine steps. Steps 1–6 are carried out in phase 1 with the evaluation team and the project’s decision makers—typically, the architecture team, project manager, and client. In phase 2, with all stakeholders involved, steps 1–6 are summarized and steps 7–9 are carried out. ##### Step 1: Present the ATAM The first step calls for the evaluation leader to present the ATAM to the assembled project representatives. This time is used to explain the process that everyone will be following, to answer questions, and to set the context and expectations for the remainder of the activities. Using a standard presentation, the leader describes the ATAM steps in brief and the outputs of the evaluation.
