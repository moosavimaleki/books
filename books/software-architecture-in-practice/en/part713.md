The duration of an LAE exercise depends on the number of quality attribute scenarios generated and examined, which is in turn based on the scope of the review. The number of scenarios examined depends on the importance of the system being reviewed. Thus an LAE exercise can be as short as a couple of hours or as long as a full day. It is carried out entirely by members internal to the organization. Because the participants are all internal to the organization and fewer in number than for the ATAM, giving everyone their say and achieving a shared understanding takes much less time. In addition, an LAE exercise, because it is a lightweight process, can be done regularly; in turn, many of the steps of the method can be omitted or only briefly touched upon. The potential steps in an LAE exercise, along with our experiences with how these play out in practice, are shown in [Table 21.3](ch21.xhtml#ch21tab03). The LAE exercise is typically convened by and led by the project architect.
