Element builders must be fluent in the specifications of their individual elements, but they may not be aware of the architectural tradeoffs—the architecture (or architect) simply constrains them in such a way as to meet the tradeoffs. A classic example is when an architect assigns performance budgets to the pieces of software involved in some larger piece of functionality. If each software unit stays within its budget, the overall transaction will meet its performance requirement. Implementers of each of the constituent pieces may not know the overall budget, but only their own. Conversely, the architects need not be experts in all aspects of algorithm design or the intricacies of the programming language—although they should certainly know enough not to design something that is difficult to build. Architects, however, are the people responsible for establishing, analyzing, and enforcing the architectural decisions and tradeoffs. ### 2.7 Influences on Organizational Structure
