*  Data model. The data model describes the static information structure in terms of data entities and their relationships. For example, in a banking system, entities will typically include Account, Customer, and Loan. Account has several attributes, such as account number, type (savings or checking), status, and current balance. A relationship may dictate that one customer can have one or more accounts, and one account is associated with one or more customers. [Figure 1.9](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig09) shows an example of a data model. ![Illustration of a sample data model.](graphics/01fig09.jpg) Figure 1.9 Data model
