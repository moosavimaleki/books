Dependency on other computation. A computation may have to wait because it must synchronize with the results of another computation or because it is waiting for the results of a computation that it initiated. If a component calls another component and must wait for that component to respond, the time can be significant when the called component is at the other end of a network (as opposed to co-located on the same processor), or when the called component is heavily loaded. *  Contention for resources. Many resources can be used by only a single client at a time. As a consequence, other clients must wait for access to those resources. [Figure 9.2](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig02) shows events arriving at the system. These events may be in a single stream or in multiple streams. Multiple streams vying for the same resource or different events in the same stream vying for the same resource contribute to latency. The more contention for a resource that occurs, the more latency grows.
