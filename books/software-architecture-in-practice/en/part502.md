*  Error handling Some of these issues can be addressed by standardized means. For example, data exchange can use mechanisms such as XML, JSON, or Protocol Buffers. All software evolves, including interfaces. Three techniques that can be used to change an interface are deprecation, versioning, and extension. The interface documentation indicates what other developers need to know about an interface to use it in combination with other elements. Documenting an interface involves deciding which element operations, events, and properties to expose to the element’s actors, and detailing the interface’s syntax and semantics. ### 15.5 For Further Reading To see the difference between an XML representation, a JSON representation, and a Protocol Buffer representation of a postal address, see [https://schema.org/PostalAddress](https://schema.org/PostalAddress), [https://schema.org/PostalAddress](https://schema.org/PostalAddress), and [https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/master/src/protogen.site/wwwroot/protoc/google/type/postal_address.proto](https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/blob/master/src/protogen.site/wwwroot/protoc/google/type/postal_address.proto).

REST was defined by Roy Fielding in his PhD thesis: [ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm](http://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). ### 15.6 Discussion Questions 1. Describe the interface to a dog, or another kind of animal with which you are familiar. Describe its operations, events, and properties. Does a dog have multiple interfaces (e.g., one for a known human and another for a stranger)?
