Implementing DevOps is a process improvement effort. DevOps encompasses not only the cultural and organizational elements of any process improvement effort, but also a strong reliance on tools and architectural design. All environments are different, of course, but the tools and automation we describe are found in the typical tool chains built to support DevOps. The continuous deployment strategy we describe here is the conceptual heart of DevOps. Automated testing is, in turn, a critically important ingredient of continuous deployment, and the tooling for that often represents the highest technological hurdle for DevOps. Some forms of DevOps include logging and post-deployment monitoring of those logs, for automatic detection of errors back at the “home office,” or even monitoring to understand the user experience. This, of course, requires a “phone home” or log delivery capability in the system, which may or may not be possible or allowable in some systems. DevSecOps is a flavor of DevOps that incorporates approaches for security (for the infrastructure and for the applications it produces) into the entire process. DevSecOps is increasingly popular in aerospace and defense applications, but is also valid in any application area where DevOps is useful and a security breach would be particularly costly. Many IT applications fall in this category.
