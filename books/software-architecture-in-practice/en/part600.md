*  Newer better technology has come out, prompting a hardware/software upgrade. An example is retrofitting a 2000s car with a smartphone-connected infotainment system instead of an old radio/CD player. *  Newer technology is available that adds functionality without replacing existing functionality. For example, suppose the 2000s-era car never had a radio/CD player at all, or lacked a backup camera. ##### Logging Logs are critical when investigating and resolving incidents that have occurred or may occur. In mobile systems, the logs should be offloaded to a location where they are accessible regardless of the accessibility of the mobile system itself. This is useful not only for incident handling, but also for performing various types of analyses on the usage of the system. Many software applications do something similar when they encounter a problem and ask for permission to send the details to the vendor. For mobile systems, this logging capability is particularly important, and they may very well not ask permission to obtain the data.
