There is a strong connection between the achievement of usability and modifiability. The user interface design process consists of generating and then testing a user interface design. It is highly unlikely that you will get this right the first time, so you should plan to iterate this process—and hence you should design your architecture to make that iteration less painful. This is why usability is strongly connected to modifiability. As you iterate, deficiencies in the design are—one hopes—corrected and the process repeats. This connection has resulted in standard patterns to support user interface design. Indeed, one of the most helpful things you can do to achieve usability is to modify your system, over and over, to make it better as you learn from your users and discover improvements to be made. ### 13.1 Usability General Scenario [Table 13.1](ch13.xhtml#ch13tab01) enumerates the elements of the general scenario that characterize usability.
