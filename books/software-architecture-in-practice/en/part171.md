*  Forward error recovery. This pattern provides a way to get out of an undesirable state by moving forward to a desirable state. This often relies upon built-in error-correction capabilities, such as data redundancy, so that errors may be corrected without the need to fall back to a previous state or to retry. Forward error recovery finds a safe, possibly degraded state from which the operation can move forward. ### 4.5 For Further Reading Patterns for availability: *  You can read about patterns for fault tolerance in [[Hanmer 13](ref01.xhtml#ref_108)]. General tactics for availability: *  A more detailed discussion of some of the availability tactics in this chapter is given in [[Scott 09](ref01.xhtml#ref_226)]. This is the source of much of the material in this chapter. *  The Internet Engineering Task Force has promulgated a number of standards supporting availability tactics. These standards include Non-Stop Forwarding [IETF 2004], Ping/Echo (ICMP [IETF 1981] or ICMPv6 [RFC 2006b] Echo Request/Response), and MPLS (LSP Ping) networks [IETF 2006a].
