### 10.4 Patterns for Safety A system that unexpectedly stops operating, or starts operating incorrectly, or falls into a degraded mode of operation is likely to affect safety negatively, if not catastrophically. Hence, the first place to look for safety patterns is in patterns for availability, such as the ones described in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04). They all apply here. *  Redundant sensors. If the data produced by a sensor is important to determine whether a state is safe or unsafe, that sensor should be replicated. This protects against the failure of any single sensor. Also, independent software should monitor each sensorâ€”in essence, the redundant spare tactic from [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) applied to safety-critical hardware. Benefits: This form of redundancy, which is applied to sensors, guards against the failure of a single sensor. Tradeoffs: Redundant sensors add cost to the system, and processing the inputs from multiple sensors is more complicated than processing the input from a single sensor.
