2. In the list you compiled for question 1, which tactics and patterns are especially helpful for each? 3. For each quality attribute that you discovered as a result of question 2, write a modifiability scenario that expresses it. 4. In many laundromats, washing machines and dryers accept coins but do not give change. Instead, separate machines dispense change. In an average laundromat, there are six or eight washers and dryers for every change machine. What modifiability tactics do you see at work in this arrangement? What can you say about availability? 5. For the laundromat in question 4, describe the specific form of modifiability (using a modifiability scenario) that seems to be the aim of arranging the machines as described. 6. A wrapper, introduced in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07), is a common architectural pattern to aid modifiability. Which modifiability tactics does a wrapper embody? 7. Other common architectural patterns that can increase a systemâ€™s modifiability include blackboard, broker, peer-to-peer, model-view-controller, and reflection. Discuss each in terms of the modifiability tactics it packages.
