*  For small classes, the strategy pattern can make code slightly less readable. However, as complexity grows, breaking up the class in this way can enhance readability. #### Intercepting Filter Pattern The intercepting filter pattern is used to inject pre- and post-processing to a request or a response between a client and a service. Any number of filters can be defined and applied, in an arbitrary order, to the request before passing the request to the eventual service. For example, logging and authentication services are filters that are often useful to implement once and apply universally. Testing filters can be inserted in this way, without disturbing any of the other processing in the system. Benefits: *  This pattern, like the strategy pattern, makes classes simpler, by not placing all of the pre- and post-processing logic in the class. *  Using an intercepting filter can be a strong motivator for reuse and can dramatically reduce the size of the code base.
