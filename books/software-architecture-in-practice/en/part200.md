*  Designing the services to have appropriate responsibilities and an appropriate level of granularity is a formidable design task. *  To achieve the ability to deploy versions independently, the architecture of the services must be designed to allow for that deployment strategy. Using the manage service interactions tactic described in [Section 5.4](ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec4) can help achieve this goal. Organizations that have heavily employed the microservice architecture pattern include Google, Netflix, PayPal, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon. Many other organizations have adopted the microservice architecture pattern as well; books and conferences exist that focus on how an organization can adopt the microservice architecture pattern for its own needs. #### Patterns for Complete Replacement of Services Suppose there are N instances of Service A and you wish to replace them with N instances of a new version of Service A, leaving no instances of the original version. You wish to do this with no reduction in quality of service to the clients of the service, so there must always be N instances of the service running.
