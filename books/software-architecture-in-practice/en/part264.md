When is the change made and who makes it? Most commonly in the past, a change was made to source code. That is, a developer had to make the change, which was tested and then deployed in a new release. Now, however, the question of when a change is made is intertwined with the question of who makes it. An end user changing the screen saver is clearly making a change to one aspect of the system. Equally clear, it is not in the same category as changing the system so that it uses a different database management system. Changes can be made to the implementation (by modifying the source code), during compilation (using compile-time switches), during the build (by choice of libraries), during configuration setup (by a range of techniques, including parameter setting), or during execution (by parameter settings, plug-ins, allocation to hardware, and so forth). A change can also be made by a developer, an end user, or a system administrator. Systems that learn and adapt supply a whole different answer to the question of when a change is made and “who” makes it—it is the system itself that is the agent for change.
