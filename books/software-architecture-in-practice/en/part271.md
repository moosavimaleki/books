*  Deploy modification *  Self-modify Response measure The resources that were expended to make the change. Cost in terms of: *  Number, size, complexity of affected artifacts *  Effort *  Elapsed time *  Money (direct outlay or opportunity cost) *  Extent to which this modification affects other functions or quality attributes *  New defects introduced *  How long it took the system to adapt [Figure 8.1](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig01) illustrates a concrete modifiability scenario: A developer wishes to change the user interface. This change will be made to the code at design time, it will take less than three hours to make and test the change, and no side effects will occur. ![A sample concrete modifiability scenario is presented.](graphics/08fig01.jpg) Figure 8.1 Sample concrete modifiability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a developer. The stimulus wants to change the user interface. The artifact is the user interface. The environment is the design time. The response is the change is made. The response measure is less than 3 hours to make and test change; no side effects.
