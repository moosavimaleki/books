Table 15.1 Most Important Commands in HTTP and Their Relationship to CRUD Database Operations HTTP Command CRUD Operation Equivalent post create get read put update/replace patch update/modify delete delete #### Representation and Structure of Exchanged Data Every interface provides the opportunity to abstract the internal data representation, which is typically built using programming language data types (e.g., objects, arrays, collections), into a different one—that is, a representation more suitable for being exchanged across different programming language implementations and sent across the network. Converting from the internal to the external representation is termed “serialization,” “marshaling,” or “translation.” In the following discussion, we focus on the selection of a general-purpose data interchange format or representation for sending information over a network. This decision is based on the following concerns: *  Expressiveness. Can the representation serialize arbitrary data structures? Is it optimized for trees of objects? Does it need to carry text written in different languages?
