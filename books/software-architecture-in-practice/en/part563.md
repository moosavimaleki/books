![An illustration of the autoscaler utilization monitoring.](graphics/17fig05.jpg) Figure 17.5 An autoscaler monitoring the utilization A figure displays three systems at the bottom and a single system at the top. The top system monitors the three systems at the bottom. An autoscaler system is shown at the top right that monitors the single system at the left. The three systems at the bottom in turn connect to the autoscaler. Because the clients do not know how many instances exist or which instance is serving their requests, autoscaling activities are invisible to service clients. Furthermore, if the client request rate decreases, an instance can be removed from the load balancer pool, halted, and deallocated, again without the clientâ€™s knowledge. As an architect of a cloud-based service, you can set up a collection of rules for the autoscaler that govern its behavior. The configuration information you provide to the autoscaler includes the following items:
