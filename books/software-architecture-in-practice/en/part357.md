##### Limit Consequences The second subcategory of containment tactics is called limit consequences. These tactics are all intended to limit the bad effects that may result from the system entering an unsafe state. The abort tactic is conceptually the simplest. If an operation is determined to be unsafe, it is aborted before it can cause damage. This technique is widely employed to ensure that systems fail safely. The degradation tactic maintains the most critical system functions in the presence of component failures, dropping or replacing functionality in a controlled way. This approach allows individual component failures to gracefully reduce system functionality in a planned, deliberate, and safe way, rather than causing a complete system failure. For example, a car navigation system may continue to operate using a (less accurate) dead reckoning algorithm in a long tunnel where it has lost its GPS satellite signal. The masking tactic masks a fault by comparing the results of several redundant components and employing a voting procedure in case one or more of the components differ. For this tactic to work as intended, the voter must be simple and highly reliable.
