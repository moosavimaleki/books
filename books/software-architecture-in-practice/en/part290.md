### 8.5 For Further Reading Serious students of software engineering and its history should read two early papers about designing for modifiability. The first is Edsger Dijkstra’s 1968 paper about the T.H.E. operating system, which is the first paper that talks about designing systems to use layers, and the modifiability benefits that this approach brings [[Dijkstra 68](ref01.xhtml#ref_77)]. The second is David Parnas’s 1972 paper that introduced the concept of information hiding. [[Parnas 72](ref01.xhtml#ref_204)] suggested defining modules not by their functionality, but by their ability to internalize the effects of changes. More patterns for modifiability are given in Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives [[Woods 11](ref01.xhtml#ref_255)]. The Decoupling Level metric [[Mo 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_181)] is an architecture-level coupling metric that can give insights into how globally coupled an architecture is. This information can be used to track coupling over time, as an early warning indicator of technical debt. A fully automated way of detecting modularity violations—and other kinds of design flaws—has been described in [Mo 19]. The detected violations can be used as a guide to refactoring, so as to increase cohesion and reduce coupling.
