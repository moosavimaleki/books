*  Much of what is useful to an architect won’t be found in even the best requirements document. Many concerns that drive an architecture do not manifest themselves at all as observables in the system being specified, and thus are not the subject of requirements specifications. ASRs often derive from business goals in the development organization itself; we’ll explore this connection in [Section 19.3](ch19.xhtml#ch19lev1sec3). Developmental qualities are also out of scope; you will rarely see a requirements document that describes teaming assumptions, for example. In an acquisition context, the requirements document represents the interests of the acquirer, not those of the developer. Stakeholders, the technical environment, and the organization itself all play a role in influencing architectures. When we discuss architecture design, in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20), we will explore these requirements in more detail. #### Sniffing out ASRs from a Requirements Document While requirements documents won’t tell an architect the whole story, they are still an important source of ASRs. Of course, ASRs will not be conveniently labeled as such; the architect should expect to perform a bit of investigation and archaeology to ferret them out.
