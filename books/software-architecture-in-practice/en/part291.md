Software modules intended for use in a software product line are often imbued with variation mechanisms that allow them to be quickly modified to serve in different applications—that is, in different members of the product line. Lists of variation mechanisms for components in a product line can be found in the works by Bachmann and Clements [[Bachmann 05](ref01.xhtml#ref_9)], Jacobson and colleagues [[Jacobson 97](ref01.xhtml#ref_130)], and Anastasopoulos and colleagues [[Anastasopoulos 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_3)]. The layers pattern comes in many forms and variations—“layers with a sidecar,” for example. [Section 2.4](ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec4) of [DSA2] sorts them all out, and discusses why (surprisingly for an architectural pattern invented more than a half-century ago) most layer diagrams for software that you’ve ever seen are very ambiguous. If you don’t want to spring for the book, then [[Bachmann 00a](ref01.xhtml#ref_7)] is a good substitute. ### 8.6 Discussion Questions 1. Modifiability comes in many flavors and is known by many names; we discussed a few in the opening section of this chapter, but that discussion only scratches the surface. Find one of the IEEE or ISO standards dealing with quality attributes, and compile a list of quality attributes that refer to some form of modifiability. Discuss the differences.
