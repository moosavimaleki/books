Orchestration works by reducing the number of dependencies between a system S and new components {Ci}, and eliminating altogether the explicit dependencies among the components {Ci}, by centralizing those dependencies at the orchestration mechanism. It may also reduce syntactic and data semantic distance if the orchestration mechanism is used in conjunction with tactics such as adherence to standards. ##### Manage Resources A resource manager is a specific form of intermediary that governs access to computing resources; it is similar to the restrict communication paths tactic. With this tactic, software components are not allowed to directly access some computing resources (e.g., threads or blocks of memory), but instead request those resources from a resource manager. Resource managers are typically responsible for allocating resource access across multiple components in a way that preserves some invariants (e.g., avoiding resource exhaustion or concurrent use), enforces some fair access policy, or both. Examples of resource managers include operating systems, transaction mechanisms in databases, use of thread pools in enterprise systems, and use of the ARINC 653 standard for space and time partitioning in safety-critical systems.
