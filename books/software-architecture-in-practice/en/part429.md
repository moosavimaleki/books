## 13 Usability People ignore design that ignores people. —Frank Chimero Usability is concerned with how easy it is for the user to accomplish a desired task and the kind of user support that the system provides. Over the years, a focus on usability has shown itself to be one of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve a system’s quality (or more precisely, the user’s perception of quality) and hence end-user satisfaction. Usability comprises the following areas: *  Learning system features. If the user is unfamiliar with a particular system or a particular aspect of it, what can the system do to make the task of learning easier? This might include providing help features. *  Using a system efficiently. What can the system do to make the user more efficient in its operation? This might include enabling the user to redirect the system after issuing a command. For example, the user may wish to suspend one task, perform several operations, and then resume that task.
