##### Barrier The barrier tactics contain problems by keeping them from propagating. The firewall tactic is a specific realization of the limit access tactic, which is described in [Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#ch11). A firewall limits access to specified resources, typically processors, memory, and network connections. The interlock tactic protects against failures arising from incorrect sequencing of events. Realizations of this tactic provide elaborate protection schemes by controlling all access to protected components, including controlling the correct sequencing of events affecting those components. #### Recovery The final category of safety tactics is recovery, which acts to place the system in a safe state. It encompasses three tactics: rollback, repair state, and reconfiguration. The rollback tactic permits the system to revert to a saved copy of a previous known good state—the rollback line—upon the detection of a failure. This tactic is often combined with checkpointing and transactions, to ensure that the rollback is complete and consistent. Once the good state is reached, then execution can continue, potentially employing other tactics such as retry or degradation to ensure that the failure does not reoccur.
