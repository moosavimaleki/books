Let’s examine a few of the reasons that we heard. First, the rate of new requirements has been accelerating for many years, and it continues to accelerate even now. Architects today are faced with a nonstop and ever-increasing stream of feature requests and bugs to fix, driven by customer and business needs and by competitive pressures. If architects aren’t paying attention to the modularity of their system (and, no, microservices are not a panacea here), that system will quickly become an anchor—hard to understand, change, debug, and modify, and weighing down the business. Second, while the level of abstraction in systems is increasing—we can and do regularly use many sophisticated services, blissfully unaware of how they are implemented—the complexity of the systems we are being asked to create is increasing at least as quickly. This is an arms race, and the architects aren’t winning! Architecture has always been about taming complexity, and that just isn’t going to go away anytime soon.
