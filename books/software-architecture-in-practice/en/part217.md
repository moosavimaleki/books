Table 6.1 Energy Efficiency General Scenario Portion of Scenario Description Possible Values Source This specifies who or what requests or initiates a request to conserve or manage energy. End user, manager, system administrator, automated agent Stimulus A request to conserve energy. Total usage, maximum instantaneous usage, average usage, etc. Artifacts This specifies what is to be managed. Specific devices, servers, VMs, clusters, etc. Environment Energy is typically managed at runtime, but many interesting special cases exist, based on system characteristics. Runtime, connected, battery-powered, low-battery mode, power-conservation mode Response What actions the system takes to conserve or manage energy usage. One or more of the following: *  Disable services *  Deallocate runtime services *  Change allocation of services to servers *  Run services at a lower consumption mode *  Allocate/deallocate servers *  Change levels of service *  Change scheduling Response measure The measures revolve around the amount of energy saved or consumed and the effects on other functions or quality attributes.
