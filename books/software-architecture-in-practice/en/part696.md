Scenario walkthrough leads to a discussion of possible risks and non-risks. For example: *  The frequency of heartbeats affects the time in which the system can detect a failed component. Some assignments will result in unacceptable values of this response; these are risks. *  The frequency of heartbeats determines the time for detection of a fault. *  Higher frequency leads to improved availability but also consumes more processing time and communication bandwidth (potentially leading to reduced performance). This is a tradeoff. These issues, in turn, may catalyze a deeper analysis, depending on how the architect responds. For example, if the architect cannot characterize the number of clients and cannot say how load balancing will be achieved by allocating processes to hardware, there is little point in proceeding to any performance analysis. If such questions can be answered, the evaluation team can perform at least a rudimentary, or back-of-the-envelope, analysis to determine if these architectural decisions are problematic vis-Ã -vis the quality attribute requirements they are meant to address.
