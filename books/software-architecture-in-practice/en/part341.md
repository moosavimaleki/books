In 2009, an employee of the Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station used a cybernetwork to remotely—and accidentally—activate an unused turbine with a few errant keystrokes. The offline turbine created a “water hammer” that flooded and then destroyed the plant and killed dozens of workers. There are many other equally notorious examples. The Therac 25 fatal radiation overdose, the Ariane 5 explosion, and a hundred lesser-known accidents all caused harm because the computer was connected to the environment: a turbine, an X-ray emitter, and a rocket’s steering controls, in the examples just cited. The infamous Stuxnet virus was created to intentionally cause damage and destruction. In these cases, software commanded some hardware in its environment to take a disastrous action, and the hardware obeyed. Actuators are devices that connect hardware to software; they are the bridge between the world of 0s and 1s and the world of motion and control. Send a digital value to an actuator (or write a bit string in the hardware register corresponding to the actuator) and that value is translated to some mechanical action, for better or worse.
