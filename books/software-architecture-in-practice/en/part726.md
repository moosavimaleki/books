For the documentation to continue to provide value over time, it needs to be kept up to date. ### 22.2 Notations Notations for documenting views differ considerably in their degree of formality. Roughly speaking, there are three main categories of notation: *  Informal notations. Views may be depicted (often graphically) using general-purpose diagramming and editing tools and visual conventions chosen for the system at hand. Most box-and-line drawings you’ve probably seen fall into this category—think PowerPoint or something similar, or hand-drawn sketches on a whiteboard. The semantics of the description are characterized in natural language, and cannot be formally analyzed. *  Semiformal notations. Views may be expressed in a standardized notation that prescribes graphical elements and rules of construction, but does not provide a complete semantic treatment of the meaning of those elements. Rudimentary analysis can be applied to determine if a description satisfies syntactic properties. UML and its system-engineering adjunct SysML are semiformal notations in this sense. Most widely used commercially available modeling tools employ notations in this category.
