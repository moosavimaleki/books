#### Unsafe State Avoidance ##### Substitution This tactic employs protection mechanisms—often hardware-based—for potentially dangerous software design features. For example, hardware protection devices such as watchdogs, monitors, and interlocks can be used in lieu of software versions. Software versions of these mechanisms can be starved of resources, whereas a separate hardware device provides and controls its own resources. Substitution is typically beneficial only when the function being replaced is relatively simple. ##### Predictive Model The predictive model tactic, as introduced in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04), predicts the state of health of system processes, resources, or other properties (based on monitoring the state), not only to ensure that the system is operating within its nominal operating parameters but also to provide early warning of a potential problem. For example, some automotive cruise control systems calculate the closing rate between the vehicle and an obstacle (or another vehicle) ahead and warn the driver before the distance and time become too small to avoid a collision. A predictive model is typically combined with condition monitoring, which we discuss later.
