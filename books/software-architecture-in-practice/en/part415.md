*  Executable assertions. With this tactic, assertions are (usually) hand-coded and placed at desired locations to indicate when and where a program is in a faulty state. The assertions are often designed to check that data values satisfy specified constraints. Assertions are defined in terms of specific data declarations, and they must be placed where the data values are referenced or modified. Assertions can be expressed as pre- and post-conditions for each method and also as class-level invariants. This increases the system’s observability, as an assertion can be flagged as having failed. Assertions systematically inserted where data values change can be seen as a manual way to produce an “extended” type. Essentially, the user is annotating a type with additional checking code. Anytime an object of that type is modified, the checking code executes automatically, with warnings being generated if any conditions are violated. To the extent that the assertions cover the test cases, they effectively embed the test oracle in the code—assuming the assertions are correct and correctly coded.
