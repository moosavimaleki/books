#### Some Useful C&C Structures C&C structures show a runtime view of the system. In these structures, the modules just described have all been compiled into executable forms. Thus all C&C structures are orthogonal to the module-based structures and deal with the dynamic aspects of a running system. For example, one code unit (module) could be compiled into a single service that is replicated thousands of times in an execution environment. Or 1,000 modules can be compiled and linked together to produce a single runtime executable (component). The relation in all C&C structures is attachment, showing how the components and the connectors are hooked together. (The connectors themselves can be familiar constructs such as “invokes.”) Useful C&C structures include: *  Service structure. The units here are services that interoperate through a service coordination mechanism, such as messages. The service structure is an important structure to help engineer a system composed of components that may have been developed independently of each other.
