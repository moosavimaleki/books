### 23.6 For Further Reading The field of technical debt has, at this point, a rich research literature. The term technical debt was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992 (although, at the time, he simply called it “debt” [[Cunningham 92](ref01.xhtml#ref_73)]). This idea was refined and elaborated by many others, most prominent among them Martin Fowler [[Fowler 09](ref01.xhtml#ref_91)] and Steve McConnell [[McConnell 07](ref01.xhtml#ref_177)]. George Fairbanks describes the iterative nature of debt in his IEEE Software article, “Ur-Technical Debt” [[Fairbanks 20](ref01.xhtml#ref_86)]. A comprehensive look at the problem of managing technical debt can be found in [[Kruchten 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_154)]. The definition of architecture debt used in this chapter was borrowed from [[Xiao 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_260)]. The SoftServe case study was published in [[Kazman 15](ref01.xhtml#ref_142)]. Some of the tools used to create and analyze DSMs are described in [[Xiao 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_259)]. The tools to detect architectural flaws are introduced in [[Mo 15](ref01.xhtml#ref_180)]. The impacts of architecture flaws have been discussed and empirically investigated in several papers, including [[Feng 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_88)] and [[Mo 18](ref01.xhtml#ref_182)].
