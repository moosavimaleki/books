[Figure 23.2](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig02) shows a very different picture of the Camel project. For example, the cell at row 8, column 3 is marked with “4”: This means that there is no structural relation between BeanExpression.java and MethodNotFoundException.java, but they were found to have changed together four times in the revision history. A cell with both a number and text indicates that this pair of files has both structural and evolutionary coupling relations. For example, the cell at row 22, column 1 is marked with “dp, 3”: This means that XMLTokenizerExpression.java depends on ExpressionDefinition.java, and they were changed together three times. The matrix in [Figure 23.2](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig02) is rather dense. Although these files are generally not structurally coupled to each other, they are strongly evolutionarily coupled. Furthermore, we see many annotations in cells above the diagonal in the matrix. Thus the coupling is not just from higher-level to lower-level files, but rather goes in all directions.
