# To Prototype or Not to Prototype?

## 20 Designing an Architecture With Humberto Cervantes A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Design—including architectural design—is a complex activity to perform. It involves making a myriad of decisions that take into account many aspects of a system. In the past, this task was only entrusted to senior software engineers—gurus—with decades of hard-won experience. A systematic method provides guidance in performing this complex activity so that it can be learned and capably performed by mere mortals. In this chapter, we provide a detailed discussion of a method—Attribute-Driven Design (ADD)—that allows an architecture to be designed in a systematic, repeatable, and cost-effective way. Repeatability and teachability are the hallmarks of an engineering discipline. To make a method repeatable and teachable, we need a set of steps that any suitably trained engineer can follow.
