#### Sensor Fusion Mobile apps and IoT systems often collect data from their environment using multiple sensors. In this pattern, data from low-power sensors can be used to infer whether data needs to be collected from higher-power sensors. A common example in the mobile phone context is using accelerometer data to assess if the user has moved and, if so, to update the GPS location. This pattern assumes that accessing the low-power sensor is much cheaper, in terms of energy consumption, than accessing the higher-power sensor. Benefits: *  The obvious benefit of this pattern is the ability to minimize the usage of more energy-intensive devices in an intelligent way rather than, for example, just reducing the frequency of consulting the more energy-intensive sensor. Tradeoffs: *  Consulting and comparing multiple sensors adds up-front complexity. *  The higher-energy-consuming sensor will provide higher-quality data, albeit at the cost of increased power consumption. And it will provide this data more quickly, since using the more energy-intensive sensor alone takes less time than first consulting a secondary sensor.
