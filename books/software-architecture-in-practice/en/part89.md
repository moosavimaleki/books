Not only does architecture prescribe the structure of the system being developed, but that structure becomes engraved in the structure of the development project (and sometimes the structure of the entire organization). The normal method for dividing up the labor in a large project is to assign different groups different portions of the system to construct. This so-called work-breakdown structure of a system is manifested in the architecture in the work assignment structure described in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01). Because the architecture includes the broadest decomposition of the system, it is typically used as the basis for the work-breakdown structure. The work-breakdown structure in turn dictates units of planning, scheduling, and budget; interteam communication channels; configuration control and file-system organization; integration and test plans and procedures; and even project minutiae such as how the project intranet is organized and who sits with whom at the company picnic. Teams communicate with each other in terms of the interface specifications for their elements. The maintenance activity, when launched, will also reflect the software structure, with teams formed to maintain specific elements from the architectureâ€”the database, the business rules, the user interface, the device drivers, and so forth.
