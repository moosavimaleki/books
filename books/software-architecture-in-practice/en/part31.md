#### Not All Architectures Are Good Architectures Our definition is indifferent as to whether the architecture for a system is a good one or a bad one. An architecture may either support or hinder achieving the important requirements for a system. Assuming that we do not accept trial and error as the best way to choose an architecture for a system—that is, picking an architecture at random, building the system from it, and then hacking away and hoping for the best—this raises the importance of architecture design, which is treated in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20) and architecture evaluation, which will be dealt with in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21). #### Architecture Includes Behavior The behavior of each element is part of the architecture insofar as that behavior can help you reason about the system. The behavior of elements embodies how they interact with each other and with the environment. This is clearly part of our definition of architecture and will have an effect on the properties exhibited by the system, such as its runtime performance.
