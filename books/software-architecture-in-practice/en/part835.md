### 25.1 Competence of Individuals: Duties, Skills, and Knowledge of Architects Architects perform many activities beyond directly producing an architecture. These activities, which we call duties, form the backbone of an individual’s architecture competence. Writers about architects also speak of skills and knowledge. For example, the ability to communicate ideas clearly and to negotiate effectively are skills often ascribed to competent architects. In addition, architects need to have up-to-date knowledge about patterns, technologies, standards, quality attributes, and a host of other topics. Duties, skills, and knowledge form a triad upon which architecture competence for individuals rests. The relationship among these three is shown in [Figure 25.1](ch25.xhtml#ch25fig01)—namely, skills and knowledge support the ability to perform the required duties. Infinitely talented architects are of no use if they cannot (for whatever reason) perform the duties required of the position; we would not say they were competent. ![A figure shows skills and knowledge on the left and right respectively. The duties ellipse is shown at the top between the two. An arrow marks each from skills and knowledge points to the duties at the top representing the support.](graphics/25fig01.jpg)
