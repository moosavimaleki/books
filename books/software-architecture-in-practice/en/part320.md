*  First-in/first-out. FIFO queues treat all requests for resources as equals and satisfy them in turn. One possibility with a FIFO queue is that one request will be stuck behind another one that takes a long time to generate a response. As long as all of the requests are truly equal, this is not a problemâ€”but if some requests are of higher priority than others, it creates a challenge. *  Fixed-priority scheduling. Fixed-priority scheduling assigns each source of resource requests a particular priority and assigns the resources in that priority order. This strategy ensures better service for higher-priority requests. However, it also admits the possibility that a lower-priority, but still important request might take an arbitrarily long time to be serviced, because it is stuck behind a series of higher-priority requests. Three common prioritization strategies are these: Semantic importance. Semantic importance assigns a priority statically according to some domain characteristic of the task that generates it.
