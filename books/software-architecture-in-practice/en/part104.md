# Functional Requirements

## 3 Understanding Quality Attributes Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution. —William A. Foster Many factors determine the qualities that must be provided for in a system’s architecture. These qualities go beyond functionality, which is the basic statement of the system’s capabilities, services, and behavior. Although functionality and other qualities are closely related, as you will see, functionality often takes the front seat in the development scheme. This preference is shortsighted, however. Systems are frequently redesigned not because they are functionally deficient—the replacements are often functionally identical—but because they are difficult to maintain, port, or scale; or they are too slow; or they have been compromised by hackers. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02), we said that architecture was the first place in software creation in which the achievement of quality requirements could be addressed. It is the mapping of a system’s functionality onto software structures that determines the architecture’s support for qualities. In [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[14](ch14.xhtml#ch14), we discuss how various qualities are supported by architectural design decisions. In [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20), we show how to integrate all of your drivers, including quality attribute decisions, into a coherent design.
