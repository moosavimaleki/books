Happily, for many purposes, almost-accurate time is good enough. However, as a practical matter, you should assume some level of error exists between the clock readings on two different devices. For this reason, most distributed systems are designed so that time synchronization among devices is not required for applications to function correctly. You can use device time to trigger periodic actions, to timestamp log entries, and for a few other purposes where accurate coordination with other devices is not necessary. Also happily, for many proposes, it is more important to know the order of events rather than the time at which those events occurred. Trading decisions on the stock market fall into this category, as do online auctions of any form. Both rely on processing packets in the same order in which they were transmitted. For critical coordination across devices, most distributed systems use mechanisms such as vector clocks (which are not really clocks, but rather counters that trace actions as they propagate through the services in an application) to determine whether one event happened before another event, rather than comparing times. This ensures that the application can apply the actions in the correct order. Most of the data coordination mechanisms that we discuss in the next section rely on this kind of ordering of actions.
