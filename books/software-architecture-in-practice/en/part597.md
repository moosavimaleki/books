An important point here is test traceability: If an issue is found in step 4, it needs to be reproducible and traceable through all test setups, since a fix will have to go through all four test levels again. ##### Deploying Updates In a mobile device, updates to the system either fix issues, provide new functionality, or install features that are unfinished but perhaps were partially installed at the time of an earlier release. Such an update may target the software, the data, or (less often) the hardware. Modern cars, for example, require software updates, which are fetched over networks or downloaded via USB interfaces. Beyond providing for the capability of updates during operation, the following specific issues relate to deploying updates: *  Maintaining data consistency. For consumer devices, upgrades tend to be automatic and one-way (there’s no way to roll back to an earlier version). This suggests keeping data on the cloud is a good idea—but then all the interactions between the cloud and the application need to be tested.
