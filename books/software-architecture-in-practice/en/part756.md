*  UML activity diagrams are similar to flowcharts. They show a business process as a sequence of steps (called actions) and include notation to express conditional branching and concurrency, as well as to show sending and receiving events. Arrows between actions indicate the flow of control. Optionally, activity diagrams can indicate the architecture element or actor performing the actions. Notably, activity diagrams can express concurrency. A fork node (depicted as a thick bar orthogonal to the flow arrows) splits the flow into two or more concurrent flows of actions. These concurrent flows may later be synchronized into a single flow through a join node (also depicted as an orthogonal bar). The join node waits for all incoming flows to complete before proceeding. Unlike sequence and communication diagrams, activity diagrams donâ€™t show the actual operations being performed on specific objects. Thus these diagrams are useful to broadly describe the steps in a specific workflow. Conditional branching (shown by a diamond symbol) allows a single diagram to represent multiple traces, although an activity diagram usually does not attempt to show all possible traces or the complete behavior for the system (or part of it). [Figure 22.3](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig03) shows an activity diagram.
