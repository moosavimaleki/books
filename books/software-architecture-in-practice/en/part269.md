*  Location independence refers to the case where two pieces of distributed software interact and the location of one or both of the pieces is not known prior to runtime. Alternatively, the location of these pieces may change during runtime. In distributed systems, services are often deployed to arbitrary locations, and clients of those services must discover their location dynamically. In addition, services in a distributed system must often make their location discoverable once they have been deployed to a location. Designing the system for location independence means that the location will be easy to modify with minimal impact on the rest of the system. ### 8.1 Modifiability General Scenario From these considerations, we can construct the general scenario for modifiability. [Table 8.1](ch08.xhtml#ch08tab01) summarizes this scenario. Table 8.1 General Scenario for Modifiability Portion of Scenario Description Possible Values Source The agent that causes a change to be made. Most are human actors, but the system might be one that learns or self-modifies, in which case the source is the system itself.
