In this section, we explore these three categories of structure-based views and then introduce a new category: quality views. #### Module Views A module is an implementation unit that provides a coherent set of responsibilities. A module might take the form of a class, a collection of classes, a layer, an aspect, or any decomposition of the implementation unit. Example module views are decomposition, uses, and layers. Every module view has a collection of properties assigned to it. These properties express important information associated with each module and the relationships among the modules, as well as constraints on the module. Example properties include responsibilities, visibility information (what other modules can use it), and revision history. The relations that modules have to one another include is-part-of, depends-on, and is-a. The way in which a system’s software is decomposed into manageable units remains one of the important forms of system structure. At a minimum, it determines how a system’s source code is decomposed into units, what kinds of assumptions each unit can make about services provided by other units, and how those units are aggregated into larger ensembles. It also includes shared data structures that impact, and are impacted by, multiple units. Module structures often determine how changes to one part of a system might affect other parts and hence the ability of a system to support modifiability, portability, and reuse.
