### 2.10 Transferable, Reusable Model The earlier in the life cycle reuse is applied, the greater the benefit that can be achieved from this practice. While code reuse offers a benefit, reuse of architectures provides opportunities for tremendous leverage for systems with similar requirements. When architectural decisions can be reused across multiple systems, all of the early-decision consequences we described in earlier sections are also transferred to those systems. A product line or family is a set of systems that are all built using the same set of shared assetsâ€”software components, requirements documents, test cases, and so forth. Chief among these assets is the architecture that was designed to handle the needs of the entire family. Product-line architects choose an architecture (or a family of closely related architectures) that will serve all envisioned members of the product line. The architecture defines what is fixed for all members of the product line and what is variable.
