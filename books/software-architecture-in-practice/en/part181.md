Similarly, a continuous deployment mindset forces you to think about the testing infrastructure earlier in the development process. This is necessary because designing for continuous deployment requires continuous automated testing. In addition, the need to be able to roll back or disable features leads to architectural decisions about mechanisms such as feature toggles and backward compatibility of interfaces. These decisions are best taken early on. # The Effect of Virtualization on the Different Environments Before the widespread use of virtualization technology, the environments that we describe here were physical facilities. In most organizations, the development, integration, and staging environments comprised hardware and software procured and operated by different groups. The development environment might consist of a few desktop computers that the development team repurposed as servers. The integration environment was operated by the test or quality-assurance team, and might consist of some racks, populated with previous-generation equipment from the data center. The staging environment was operated by the operations team and might have hardware similar to that used in production.
