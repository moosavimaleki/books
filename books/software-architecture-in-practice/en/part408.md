The portion being tested: *  A unit of code (corresponding to a module in the architecture) *  Components *  Services *  Subsystems *  The entire system *  The test infrastructure Response The system and its test infrastructure can be controlled to perform the desired tests, and the results from the test can be observed. One or more of the following: *  Execute test suite and capture results *  Capture activity that resulted in the fault *  Control and monitor the state of the system Response measure Response measures are aimed at representing how easily a system under test “gives up” its faults or defects. One or more of the following: *  Effort to find a fault or class of faults *  Effort to achieve a given percentage of state space coverage *  Probability of a fault being revealed by the next test *  Time to perform tests *  Effort to detect faults
