### 4.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Availability Based on the tactics described in [Section 4.2](ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2), we can create a set of availability tacticsâ€“inspired questions, as presented in [Table 4.3](ch04.xhtml#ch04tab03). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support availability, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth. Table 4.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Availability Tactics Group Tactics Question Support? (Y/N) Risk Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Detect Faults Does the system use ping/echo to detect failure of a component or connection, or network congestion? Does the system use a component to monitor the state of health of other parts of the system? A system monitor can detect failure or congestion in the network or other shared resources, such as from a denial-of-service attack.
