Phases are managed by making the probabilities complex numbers. The amplitudes (probabilities) are designated as |α|2 and |β|2. If |α|2 is 40 percent and |β|2 is 60 percent, then 4 out of 10 measurements will be 0, and 6 out of those 10 measurements will be 1. These amplitudes are subject to some probability of measurement error, and reducing this error probability is one of the engineering challenges of building quantum computers. There are two consequences of this definition: 1.  |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Because |α|2 and |β|2 are probabilities of a measurement delivering 0 or 1, respectively, and because a measurement will deliver one or the other, the sum of the probabilities must be 1. 2.  There is no copying of a qubit. A copy from classical bit A to classical bit B is a read of bit A followed by a store of that value into B. The measurement (i.e., read) of qubit A will destroy A and deliver either a value of 0 or a value of 1. The store into qubit B will thus be either a 0 or a 1 and will not encompass the probabilities or phases that were embedded into A.
