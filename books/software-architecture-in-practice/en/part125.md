### 3.6 Analyzing Quality Attribute Design Decisions: Tactics-Based Questionnaires In this section, we introduce a tool the analyst can use to understand potential quality attribute behavior at various stages through the architecture’s design: tactics-based questionnaires. Analyzing how well quality attributes have been achieved is a critical part of the task of designing an architecture. And (no surprise) you shouldn’t wait until your design is complete before you begin to do it. Opportunities for quality attribute analysis crop up at many different points in the software development life cycle, even very early ones. At any point, the analyst (who might be the architect) needs to respond appropriately to whatever artifacts have been made available for analysis. The accuracy of the analysis and expected degree of confidence in the analysis results will vary according to the maturity of the available artifacts. But no matter the state of the design, we have found tactics-based questionnaires to be helpful in gaining insights into the architecture’s ability (or likely ability, as it is refined) to provide the needed quality attributes.
