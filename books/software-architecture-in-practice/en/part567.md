### 17.4 Summary The cloud is composed of distributed data centers, with each data center containing tens of thousands of computers. It is managed through a management gateway that is accessible over the Internet and is responsible for allocating, deallocating, and monitoring VMs, as well as measuring resource usage and computing billing. Because of the large number of computers in a data center, failure of a computer in such a center happens quite frequently. You, as an architect of a service, should assume that at some point, the VMs on which your service is executing will fail. You should also assume that your requests for other services will exhibit a long tail distribution, such that as many as 5 percent of your requests will take 5 to 10 times longer than the average request. Thus you must be concerned about the availability of your service. Because single instances of your service may not be able to satisfy all requests in a timely manner, you may decide to run multiple VMs or containers containing instances of your service. These multiple instances sit behind a load balancer. The load balancer receives requests from clients and distributes the requests to the various instances.
