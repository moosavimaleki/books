In 1972, Dijkstra and Hoare, along with Ole-Johan Dahl, argued that programs should be decomposed into independent components with small and simple interfaces. They called their approach structured programming, but arguably this was the debut of software architecture [[Dijkstra 72](ref01.xhtml#ref_78)]. Mary Shaw and David Garlan, together and separately, produced a major body of work that helped create the field of study we call software architecture. They established some of its fundamental principles and, among other things, catalogued a seminal family of architectural styles (a concept similar to patterns), several of which appear in this chapter as architectural structures. Start with [[Garlan 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_99)]. Software architectural patterns have been extensively catalogued in the series Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture [Buschmann 96 and others]. We also deal with architectural patterns throughout [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02) of this book. Early papers on architectural views as used in industrial development projects are [[Soni 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_232)] and [[Kruchten 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_151)]. The former grew into a book [[Hofmeister 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_114)] that presents a comprehensive picture of using views in development and analysis.
