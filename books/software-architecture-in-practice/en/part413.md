*  Abstract data sources. Similar to the case when controlling a program’s state, the ability to control its input data makes it easier to test. Abstracting the interfaces lets you substitute test data more easily. For example, if you have a database of customer transactions, you could design your architecture so that you can readily point your test system at other test databases, or possibly even to files of test data instead, without having to change your functional code. *  Sandbox. “Sandboxing” refers to isolating an instance of the system from the real world to enable experimentation that is unconstrained by any worries about having to undo the consequences of the experiment. Testing is facilitated by the ability to operate the system in such a way that it has no permanent consequences, or so that any consequences can be rolled back. The sandbox tactic can be used for scenario analysis, training, and simulation. Simulation, in particular, is a commonly employed strategy for testing and training in contexts where failure in the real world might lead to severe consequences.
