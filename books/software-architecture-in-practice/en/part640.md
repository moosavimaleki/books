At this point, the primary functionality—typically captured as a set of use cases or user stories—and QA scenarios should have been prioritized, ideally by your most important project stakeholders. (You can employ several different techniques to elicit and prioritize them, as discussed in [Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#ch19)). You, the architect, must now “own” these. For example, you need to check whether any important stakeholders were overlooked in the original requirements elicitation process, and whether any business conditions have changed since the prioritization was performed. These inputs really do “drive” design, so getting them right and getting their priority right are crucial. We cannot stress this point strongly enough. Software architecture design, like most activities in software engineering, is a “garbage-in-garbage-out” process. The results of ADD cannot be good if the inputs are poorly formed. The drivers become part of an architectural design backlog that you should use to perform the different design iterations. When you have made design decisions that account for all of the items in the backlog, you’ve completed this round. (We discuss the idea of a backlog in more depth in [Section 20.8](ch20.xhtml#ch20lev1sec8).)
