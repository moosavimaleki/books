Once you have a set of specific scenarios, then you can work to generalize the collection. Look at the set of stimuli you’ve collected, the set of responses, the set of response measures, and so on. Use those to construct a general scenario by making each part of the general scenario a generalization of the specific instances you collected. #### Model the Quality Attribute If you can build (or even better, find) a conceptual model of the QA, that foundation can be helpful in creating a set of design approaches for it. By “model,” we don’t mean anything more than an understanding of the set of parameters to which the QA is sensitive and the set of architectural characteristics that influence those parameters. For example, a model of modifiability might tell us that modifiability is a function of how many places in a system have to be changed in response to a modification, and the interconnectedness of those places. A model for performance might tell us that throughput is a function of transactional workload, the dependencies among the transactions, and the number of transactions that can be processed in parallel.
