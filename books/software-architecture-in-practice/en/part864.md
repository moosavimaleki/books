The phase value is an angle between 0 and 2Î  radians. It does not affect the probabilities of the superposition, but gives another lever to manipulate qubits. Some quantum algorithms mark certain qubits by manipulating their phase. #### Operations on Qubits Some single qubit operations are analogs of classical bit operations, whereas others are specific to qubits. One characteristic of most quantum operations is that they are invertible; that is, given the result of an operation, it is possible to recover the input into that operation. Invertibility is another distinction between classical bit operations and qubit operations. The one exception to invertibility is the READ operation: Since measurement is destructive, the result of a READ operation does not allow the recovery of the original qubit. Examples of qubit operations include the following: 1.  A READ operation takes as input a single qubit and produces as output either a 0 or a 1 with probabilities determined by the amplitudes of the input qubit. The value of the input qubit collapses to either a 0 or a 1.
