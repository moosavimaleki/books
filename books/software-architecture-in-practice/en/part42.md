Module structures allow us to answer questions such as the following: *  What is the primary functional responsibility assigned to each module? *  What other software elements is a module allowed to use? *  What other software does it actually use and depend on? *  What modules are related to other modules by generalization or specialization (i.e., inheritance) relationships? Module structures convey this information directly, but they can also be used to answer questions about the impact on the system when the responsibilities assigned to each module change. Thus module structures are the primary tools for reasoning about a system’s modifiability. 3.  Allocation structures establish the mapping from software structures to the system’s nonsoftware structures, such as its organization, or its development, test, and execution environments. Allocation structures answer questions such as the following: *  Which processor(s) does each software element execute on? *  In which directories or files is each element stored during development, testing, and system building?
