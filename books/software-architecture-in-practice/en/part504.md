7. On June 4, 1996, an Ariane 5 rocket failed quite spectacularly, only 37 seconds after launch. Research this failure, and discuss what better interface discipline could have done to prevent it. 8. A database schema represents an interface between an element and a database; it provides the metadata for accessing the database. Given this view, schema evolution is a form of interface evolution. Discuss ways in which a schema can evolve and not break the existing interface, and ways in which it does break it. Describe how deprecation, versioning, and extension apply to schema evolution.
