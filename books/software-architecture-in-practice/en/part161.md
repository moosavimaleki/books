Does the system employ exception handling to deal with faults? Typically the handling involves either reporting, correcting, or masking the fault. Does the system employ rollback, so that it can revert to a previously saved good state (the “rollback line”) in the event of a fault? Can the system perform in-service software upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner? Does the system systematically retry in cases where the component or connection failure may be transient? Can the system simply ignore faulty behavior (e.g., ignore messages when it is determined that those messages are spurious)? Does the system have a policy of degradation when resources are compromised, maintaining the most critical system functions in the presence of component failures, and dropping less critical functions? Does the system have consistent policies and mechanisms for reconfiguration after failures, reassigning responsibilities to the resources left functioning, while maintaining as much functionality as possible?
