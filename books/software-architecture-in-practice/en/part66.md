Every system has a software architecture, but this architecture may or may not be documented and disseminated. There is no such thing as an inherently good or bad architecture. Architectures are either more or less fit for some purpose. ### 1.5 For Further Reading If you’re keenly interested in software architecture as a field of study, you might be interested in reading some of the pioneering work. Most of it does not mention “software architecture” at all, as this phrase evolved only in the mid-1990s, so you’ll have to read between the lines. Edsger Dijkstra’s 1968 paper on the T.H.E. operating system introduced the concept of layers [[Dijkstra 68](ref01.xhtml#ref_77)]. The early work of David Parnas laid many conceptual foundations, including information hiding [[Parnas 72](ref01.xhtml#ref_204)], program families [[Parnas 76](ref01.xhtml#ref_206)], the structures inherent in software systems [[Parnas 74](ref01.xhtml#ref_205)], and the uses structure to build subsets and supersets of systems [[Parnas 79](ref01.xhtml#ref_207)]. All of Parnas’s papers can be found in the more easily accessible collection of his important papers [[Hoffman 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_113)]. Modern distributed systems owe their existence to the concept of cooperating sequential processes that (among others) Sir C. A. R. (Tony) Hoare was instrumental in conceptualizing and defining [[Hoare 85](ref01.xhtml#ref_112)].
