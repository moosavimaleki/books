Second, lists often generate more controversy than understanding. You might argue persuasively that “functional correctness” should be part of “reliability,” or that “portability” is just a kind of “modifiability,” or that “maintainability” is a kind of “modifiability” (not the other way around). The writers of ISO 25010 apparently spent time and effort deciding to make security its own characteristic, instead of a sub-characteristic of functionality, which it was in a previous version. We strongly believe that effort in making these arguments could be better spent elsewhere. Third, these lists often purport to be taxonomies—that is, lists with the special property that every member can be assigned to exactly one place. But QAs are notoriously squishy in this regard. For example, we discussed denial of service as being part of security, availability, performance, and usability in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03). These observations reinforce the lesson introduced in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03): QA names, by themselves, are largely useless and are at best invitations to begin a conversation. Moreover, spending time worrying about which qualities are subqualities of which other qualities is almost useless. Instead, scenarios provide the best way for us to specify precisely what we mean when we speak of a QA.
