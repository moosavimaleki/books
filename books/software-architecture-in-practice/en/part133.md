Distinguishing between faults and failures allows us to discuss repair strategies. If code containing a fault is executed but the system is able to recover from the fault without any observable deviation from the otherwise specified behavior, we say that no failure has occurred. The availability of a system can be measured as the probability that it will provide the specified services within the required bounds over a specified time interval. A well-known expression is used to derive steady-state availability (which came from the world of hardware): MTBF/(MTBF + MTTR) where MTBF refers to the mean time between failures and MTTR refers to the mean time to repair. In the software world, this formula should be interpreted to mean that when thinking about availability, you should think about what will make your system fail, how likely it is that such an event will occur, and how much time will be required to repair it.
