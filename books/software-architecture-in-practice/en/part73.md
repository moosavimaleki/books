### 2.1 Inhibiting or Enabling a System’s Quality Attributes A system’s ability to meet its desired (or required) quality attributes is substantially determined by its architecture. If you remember nothing else from this book, remember that. This relationship is so important that we’ve devoted all of [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02) of this book to expounding that message in detail. Until then, keep these examples in mind as a starting point: *  If your system requires high performance, then you need to pay attention to managing the time-based behavior of elements, their use of shared resources, and the frequency and volume of their interelement communication. *  If modifiability is important, then you need to pay attention to assigning responsibilities to elements and limiting the interactions (coupling) of those elements so that the majority of changes to the system will affect a small number of those elements. Ideally, each change will affect just a single element.
