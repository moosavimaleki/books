Response What should happen Incorporate the new components. Deploy the new components. Monitor the new components. Roll back a previous deployment. Response measure A measure of cost, time, or process effectiveness for a deployment, or for a series of deployments over time Cost in terms of: *  Number, size, and complexity of affected artifacts *  Average/worst-case effort *  Elapsed clock or calendar time *  Money (direct outlay or opportunity cost) *  New defects introduced Extent to which this deployment/rollback affects other functions or quality attributes. Number of failed deployments. Repeatability of the process. Traceability of the process. Cycle time of the process. [Figure 5.1](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01) illustrates a concrete deployability scenario: “A new release of an authentication/authorization service (which our product uses) is made available in the component marketplace and the product owner decides to incorporate this version into the release. The new service is tested and deployed to the production environment within 40 hours of elapsed time and no more than 120 person-hours of effort. The deployment introduces no defects and no SLA is violated.”
