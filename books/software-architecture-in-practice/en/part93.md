As we have said, the organizational and work-breakdown structure of a project is almost always based on its architecture. Each team or individual responsible for a work item will be able to make more accurate estimates for their piece than a project manager can, and will feel more ownership in making those estimates come true. But the best cost and schedule estimates will typically emerge from a consensus between the top-down estimates (created by the architect and the project manager) and the bottom-up estimates (created by the developers). The discussion and negotiation that result from this process create a far more accurate estimate than the use of either approach by itself. It helps if the requirements for a system have been reviewed and validated. The more up-front knowledge you have about the scope, the more accurate the cost and schedule estimates will be.
