Parameters are perhaps the best-known mechanism for introducing flexibility, and their use is reminiscent of the abstract common services tactic. A parameterized function f(a, b) is more general than the similar function f(a) that assumes b = 0. When we bind the value of some parameters at a different phase in the life cycle than the one in which we defined the parameters, we are deferring binding. In general, the later in the life cycle we can bind values, the better. However, putting the mechanisms in place to facilitate that late binding tends to be more expensiveâ€”a well-known tradeoff. And so the equation given earlier in the chapter comes into play. We want to bind as late as possible, as long as the mechanism that allows it is cost-effective. The following tactics can be used to bind values at compile time or build time: *  Component replacement (for example, in a build script or makefile)
