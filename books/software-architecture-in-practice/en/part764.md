When your iteration goal involves satisfying an important quality attribute scenario, some of the decisions that you make will play a significant role in achieving the scenario response measure. Consequently, you should take the greatest care in recording these decisions: They are essential to facilitate analysis of the design you created, to facilitate implementation, and, still later, to aid in understanding the architecture (e.g., during maintenance). Given that most design decisions are “good enough,” and seldom optimal, you also need to justify the decisions made, and to record the risks associated with your decisions so that they may be reviewed and possibly revisited. You may perceive recording design decisions as a tedious task. However, depending on the criticality of the system being developed, you can adjust the amount of information that is recorded. For example, to record a minimum of information, you can use a simple table such as [Table 22.4](ch22.xhtml#ch22tab04). If you decide to record more than this minimum, the following information might prove useful:
