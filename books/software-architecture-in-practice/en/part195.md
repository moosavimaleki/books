*  Feature toggle. Even when your code is fully tested, you might encounter issues after deploying new features. For that reason, it is convenient to be able to integrate a “kill switch” (or feature toggle) for new features. The kill switch automatically disables a feature in your system at runtime, without forcing you to initiate a new deployment. This provides the ability to control deployed features without the cost and risk of actually redeploying services. ### 5.5 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Deployability Based on the tactics described in [Section 5.4](ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec4), we can create a set of deployability tactics–inspired questions, as presented in [Table 5.2](ch05.xhtml#ch05tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support deployability, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of subsequent activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
