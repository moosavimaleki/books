*  Class (or generalization) structure. The modules in this structure are called classes, and they are related through an “inherits-from” or “is-an-instance-of” relation. This view supports reasoning about collections of similar behavior or capability and parameterized differences. The class structure allows one to reason about reuse and the incremental addition of functionality. If any documentation exists for a project that has followed an object-oriented analysis and design process, it is typically this structure. [Figure 1.8](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig08) shows a generalization structure taken from an architectural expert tool. ![The generalization structure is illustrated.](graphics/01fig08.jpg) Figure 1.8 Generalization structure A diagram displays the generalization structure. The following classes are connected to the class Fact with id as int and type as a string through an upward arrow: ScenarioVO, FunctionVO, ScenarioRespVO, FunctionRespVO, ResponsibilityVO, RelationshipVO, ParameterVO, and QuestionToUserVO. The class Fact is connected to another class java.util.observable through an upward arrow. The classes are represented in UML notation.
