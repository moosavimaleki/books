7. Author James Gleick (“A Bug and a Crash,” [around.com/ariane.xhtml](http://around.com/ariane.xhtml)) writes that “It took the European Space Agency 10 years and $7 billion to produce Ariane 5, a giant rocket capable of hurling a pair of three-ton satellites into orbit with each launch. . . . All it took to explode that rocket less than a minute into its maiden voyage . . . was a small computer program trying to stuff a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space. One bug, one crash. Of all the careless lines of code recorded in the annals of computer science, this one may stand as the most devastatingly efficient.” Write a safety scenario that addresses the Ariane 5 disaster, and discuss tactics that might have prevented it. 8. Discuss how you think safety tends to “trade off” against the quality attributes of performance, availability, and interoperability. 9. Discuss the relationship between safety and testability.
