The existence of multiple instances of your service and multiple clients has a significant impact on how you handle state. Different decisions on where to keep the state will lead to different results. The most common practice is to keep services stateless, because stateless services allow for easier recovery from failure and easier addition of new instances. Small amounts of data can be shared among service instances by using a distributed coordination service. Distributed coordination services are complicated to implement, but several proven open source implementations are available for your use. The cloud infrastructure can automatically scale your service by creating new instances when demand grows and removing instances when demand shrinks. You specify the behavior of the autoscaler through a set of rules giving the conditions for the creation or deletion of instances. ### 17.5 For Further Reading More details about how networks and virtualization work can be found in [[Bass 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_17)].
