*  Suppose you detect an error in the new Service A when you deploy it. Despite all the testing you did in the development, integration, and staging environments, when your service is deployed to production, there may still be latent errors. If you are using blue/green deployment, by the time you discover an error in the new Service A, all of the original instances may have been deleted and rolling back to the old version could take considerable time. In contrast, a rolling upgrade may allow you to discover an error in the new version of the service while instances of the old version are still available. *  From a clientâ€™s perspective, if you are using the blue/green deployment model, then at any point in time either the new version or the old version is active, but not both. If you are using the rolling upgrade pattern, both versions are simultaneously active. This introduces the possibility of two types of problems: temporal inconsistency and interface mismatch.
