#### Limit Complexity Complex software is much harder to test. Its operating state space is large, and (all else being equal) it is more difficult to re-create an exact state in a large state space than to do so in a small state space. Because testing is not just about making the software fail, but also about finding the fault that caused the failure so that it can be removed, we are often concerned with making behavior repeatable. This category includes two tactics: *  Limit structural complexity. This tactic includes avoiding or resolving cyclic dependencies between components, isolating and encapsulating dependencies on the external environment, and reducing dependencies between components in general (typically realized by lowering the coupling between components). For example, in object-oriented systems you can simplify the inheritance hierarchy: Limit the number of classes from which a class is derived, or the number of classes derived from a class.
