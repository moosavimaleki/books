*  The development and maintenance of the monitor take time and resources. *  Because of the separation this pattern achieves between actuator control and monitoring, this particular tradeoff is easy to manipulate by making the monitor as simple (easy to produce but may miss errors) or as sophisticated (more complex but catches more errors) as required. *  Separated safety. Safety-critical systems must frequently be certified as safe by some authority. Certifying a large system is expensive, but dividing a system into safety-critical portions and non-safety-critical portions can reduce those costs. The safety-critical portion must still be certified. Likewise, the division into safety-critical and non-critical portions must be certified to ensure that there is no influence on the safety-critical portion from the non-safety-critical portion. Benefits: The cost of certifying the system is reduced because you need to certify only a (usually small) portion of the total system. Cost and safety benefits accrue because the effort focuses on just those portions of the system that are germane to safety.
