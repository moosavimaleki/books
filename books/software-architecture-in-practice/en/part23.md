Over the years, we have benefited from our discussions and writings with colleagues and we would like to explicitly acknowledge them. In particular, in addition to those already mentioned, our thanks go to David Garlan, Reed Little, Paulo Merson, Judith Stafford, Mark Klein, James Scott, Carlos Paradis, Phil Bianco, Jungwoo Ryoo, and Phil Laplante. Special thanks go to John Klein, who contributed one way or another to many of the chapters in this book. In addition, we are grateful to everyone at Pearson for all their work and attention to detail in the countless steps involved in turning our words into the finished product that you are now reading. Thanks especially to Haze Humbert, who oversaw the whole process. Finally, thanks to the many, many researchers, teachers, writers, and practitioners who have, over the years, worked to turn software architecture from a good idea into an engineering discipline. This book is for you.
