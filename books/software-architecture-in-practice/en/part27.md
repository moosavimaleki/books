Structures, by contrast, are fairly easy to identify in software, and they form a powerful tool for system design and analysis. So, there we are: Architecture is about reasoning-enabling structures. Let’s look at some of the implications of our definition. #### Architecture Is a Set of Software Structures This is the first and most obvious implication of our definition. A structure is simply a set of elements held together by a relation. Software systems are composed of many structures, and no single structure can lay claim to being the architecture. Structures can be grouped into categories, and the categories themselves provide useful ways to think about the architecture. Architectural structures can be organized into three useful categories, which will play an important role in the design, documentation, and analysis of architectures: 1.  Component-and-connector structures 2.  Module structures 3.  Allocation structures We’ll delve more into these types of structures in the next section.
