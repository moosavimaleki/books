A couple of times we began an evaluation, only to lose the architect in the middle of the exercise. In one case, the architect resigned between preparation and execution of the evaluation. This organization was in turmoil, and the architect simply got a better offer in a calmer environment elsewhere. Usually, we don’t proceed without the architect, but it was okay, because the architect’s apprentice stepped in. A little additional prework to prepare him, and we were all set. The evaluation went off as planned, and the preparation that the apprentice did for the exercise helped mightily to prepare him to step into the architect’s shoes.
