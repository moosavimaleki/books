[1](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn1). When the detection mechanism is implemented using a counter or timer that is periodically reset, this specialization of the system monitor is referred to as a watchdog. During nominal operation, the process being monitored will periodically reset the watchdog counter/timer as part of its signal that it’s working correctly; this is sometimes referred to as “petting the watchdog.” *  Ping/echo. In this tactic, an asynchronous request/response message pair is exchanged between nodes; it is used to determine reachability and the round-trip delay through the associated network path. In addition, the echo indicates that the pinged component is alive. The ping is often sent by a system monitor. Ping/echo requires a time threshold to be set; this threshold tells the pinging component how long to wait for the echo before considering the pinged component to have failed (“timed out”). Standard implementations of ping/echo are available for nodes interconnected via Internet Protocol (IP).
