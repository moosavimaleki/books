The Latency Monkey induced artificial delays in network communication to simulate service degradation and measured whether upstream services responded appropriately. *  The Conformity Monkey identified instances that did not adhere to best practices and shut them down. For example, if an instance did not belong to an auto-scaling group, it would not appropriately scale when demand went up. *  The Doctor Monkey tapped into health checks that ran on each instance as well as monitoring other external signs of health (e.g., CPU load) to detect unhealthy instances. *  The Janitor Monkey ensured that the Netflix cloud environment was running free of clutter and waste. It searched for unused resources and disposed of them. *  The Security Monkey was an extension of Conformity Monkey. It found security violations or vulnerabilities, such as improperly configured security groups, and terminated the offending instances. It also ensured that all SSL and digital rights management (DRM) certificates were valid and not coming up for renewal.
