Although software comprises an endless supply of structures, not all of them are architectural. For example, the set of lines of source code that contain the letter “z,” ordered by increasing length from shortest to longest, is a software structure. But it’s not a very interesting one, nor is it architectural. A structure is architectural if it supports reasoning about the system and the system’s properties. The reasoning should be about an attribute of the system that is important to some stakeholder(s). These include properties such as the functionality achieved by the system, the system’s ability to keep operating usefully in the face of faults or attempts to take it down, the ease or difficulty of making specific changes to the system, the system’s responsiveness to user requests, and many others. We will spend a great deal of time in this book exploring the relationship between architecture and quality attributes like these.
