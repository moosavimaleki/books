![A diagram displays the general scenario for availability.](03fig02.jpg) Figure 3.2 A general scenario for availability The availability general scenario is presented. The parts of a quality attribute scenario are shown. The source is defined as internal/external such as people hardware, software, physical infrastructure, and physical environment. The stimulus is defined as the fault such as omission, crash, incorrect timing, and incorrect response. The artifact is defined as processors, communication channels, storage, processes, affected artifacts in the system's environment. The environment is defined as the normal operation, startup, shutdown, repair mode, degraded operation, and overloaded operation. The response is defined as to prevent the fault from becoming a failure, detect the fault, and recover from the fault. The response measure is defined as the time or time interval when the system must be available, availability percentage, and the time to detect the fault. # Not My Problem Some time ago I was doing an architecture analysis on a complex system created by and for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. If you visit this organization’s website ([llnl.gov](http://llnl.gov)) and try to figure out what Livermore Labs does, you will see the word “security” mentioned over and over. The lab focuses on nuclear security, international and domestic security, and environmental and energy security. Serious stuff . . .
