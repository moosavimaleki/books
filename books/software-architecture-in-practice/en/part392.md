Resisting Attacks Does the system support data encryption, for data in transit or data at rest? Does the system design consider the separation of entities via physical separation on different servers attached to different networks, virtual machines, or an “air gap”? Does the system support changing credential settings, forcing the user to change those settings periodically or at critical events? Does the system validate input in a consistent, system-wide way—for example, using a security framework or validation class to perform actions such as filtering, canonicalization, and sanitization of external input? Reacting to Attacks Does the system support revoking access by limiting access to sensitive resources, even for normally legitimate users and uses if an attack is under way? Does the system support restricting login in instances such as multiple failed login attempts? Does the system support informing actors such as operators, other personnel, or cooperating systems when the system has detected an attack?
