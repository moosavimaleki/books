### 8.2 Tactics for Modifiability Tactics to control modifiability have as their goal controlling the complexity of making changes, as well as the time and cost to make changes. [Figure 8.2](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig02) shows this relationship. ![The goal of modifiability tactics to control the response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the changes that arrive. The response is the changes made within time and budget.](graphics/08fig02.jpg) Figure 8.2 Goal of modifiability tactics To understand modifiability, we begin with some of the earliest and most fundamental complexity measures of software design—coupling and cohesion—which were first described in the 1960s. Generally, a change that affects one module is easier and less expensive than a change that affects more than one module. However, if two modules’ responsibilities overlap in some way, then a single change may well affect them both. We can quantify this overlap by measuring the probability that a modification to one module will propagate to the other. This relationship is called coupling, and high coupling is an enemy of modifiability. Reducing the coupling between two modules will decrease the expected cost of any modification that affects either one. Tactics that reduce coupling are those that place intermediaries of various sorts between the two otherwise highly coupled modules.
