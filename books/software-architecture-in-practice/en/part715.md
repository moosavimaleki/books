A utility tree should already exist; the team reviews the existing tree and updates it, if needed, with new scenarios, new response goals, or new scenario priorities and risk assessments. 6: Brainstorm and prioritize scenarios A brief brainstorming activity can occur at this time to establish whether any new scenarios merit analysis. 7: Analyze the architectural approaches This step—mapping the highly ranked scenarios onto the architecture—consumes the bulk of the time and should focus on the most recent changes to the architecture, or on a part of the architecture that the team has not previously analyzed. If the architecture has changed, the high-priority scenarios should be reanalyzed in light of these changes. 8: Capture the results At the end of an evaluation, the team reviews the existing and newly discovered risks, non-risks, sensitivities, and tradeoffs, and discusses whether any new risk themes have arisen. There is no final report, but (as in the ATAM) a scribe is responsible for capturing results, which can then be shared and serve as the basis for risk remediation.
