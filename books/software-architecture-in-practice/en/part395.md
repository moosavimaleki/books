The patterns of activity that an IPS looks for change and evolve over time, so the patterns database must be constantly updated. *  Systems employing an IPS incur a performance cost. *  IPSs are available as commercial off-the-shelf components, which makes them unnecessary to develop but perhaps not entirely suited to a specific application. Other notable security patterns include compartmentalization and distributed responsibility. Both of these combine the “limit access” and “limit exposure” tactics—the former with respect to information, the latter with respect to activities. Just as we included (by reference) tactics for availability in our list of security tactics, patterns for availability also apply to security by counteracting attacks that seek to stop the system from operating. Consider the availability patterns discussed in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) here as well. ### 11.5 For Further Reading The architectural tactics that we have described in this chapter are only one aspect of making a system secure. Other aspects include the following:
