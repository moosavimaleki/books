Web-based system events come in the form of requests from users (numbering in the tens or tens of millions) via their clients such as web browsers. Services get events from other services. In a control system for an internal combustion engine, events come from the operatorâ€™s controls and the passage of time; the system must control both the firing of the ignition when a cylinder is in the correct position and the mixture of the fuel to maximize power and efficiency and minimize pollution. For a web-based system, a database-centric system, or a system processing input signals from its environment, the desired response might be expressed as the number of requests that can be processed in a unit of time. For the engine control system, the response might be the allowable variation in the firing time. In each case, the pattern of events arriving and the pattern of responses can be characterized, and this characterization forms the language with which to construct performance scenarios.
