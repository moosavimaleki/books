Refactoring may be done for many reasons. For example, you might refactor a system to improve its security, placing different modules into different subsystems based on their security properties. Or you might refactor a system to improve its performance, removing bottlenecks and rewriting slow portions of the code. Or you might refactor to improve the systemâ€™s modifiability. For example, when two modules are affected by the same kinds of changes over and over because they are (at least partial) duplicates of each other, the common functionality could be factored out into its own module, thereby improving cohesion and reducing the number of places that need to be changed when the next (similar) change request arrives. Code refactoring is a mainstay practice of agile development projects, as a cleanup step to make sure that teams have not produced duplicative or overly complex code. However, the concept applies to architectural elements as well.
