[Figure 12.1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig01) shows a simple model of testing in which a program processes input and produces output. An oracle is an agent (human or computational) that decides whether the output is correct by comparing the output to the expected result. Output is not just the functionally produced value, but can also include derived measures of quality attributes such as how long it took to produce the output. [Figure 12.1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig01) also indicates that the program’s internal state can be shown to the oracle, and an oracle can decide whether that state is correct—that is, it can detect whether the program has entered an erroneous state and render a judgment as to the correctness of the program. Setting and examining a program’s internal state is an aspect of testing that will figure prominently in our tactics for testability. ![A figure depicts the model of testing. The input is given to a program block. The output from the program block, the internal state from the program block, and the input are given to an oracle block that is either approved or rejected.](graphics/12fig01.jpg)
