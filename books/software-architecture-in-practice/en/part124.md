In addition, the application of a tactic depends on the context. Again, consider performance: Manage sampling rate is relevant in some real-time systems but not in all real-time systems, and certainly not in database systems or stock-trading systems where losing a single event is highly problematic. Note that there are some “super-tactics”—tactics that are so fundamental and so pervasive that they deserve special mention. For example, the modifiability tactics of encapsulation, restricting dependencies, using an intermediary, and abstracting common services are found in the realization of almost every pattern ever! But other tactics, such as the scheduling tactic from performance, also appear in many places. For example, a load balancer is an intermediary that does scheduling. We see monitoring appearing in many quality attributes: We monitor aspects of a system to achieve energy efficiency, performance, availability, and safety. Thus we should not expect a tactic to live in only one place, for just a single quality attribute. Tactics are design primitives and, as such, are found over and over in different aspects of design. This is actually an argument for why tactics are so powerful and deserving of our attention—and yours. Get to know them; they’ll be your friends.
