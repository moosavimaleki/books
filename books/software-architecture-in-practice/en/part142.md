*  Heartbeat. This fault detection mechanism employs a periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process being monitored. A special case of heartbeat is when the process being monitored periodically resets the watchdog timer in its monitor to prevent it from expiring and thus signaling a fault. For systems where scalability is a concern, transport and processing overhead can be reduced by piggybacking heartbeat messages onto other control messages being exchanged. The difference between heartbeat and ping/echo lies in who holds the responsibility for initiating the health checkâ€”the monitor or the component itself. *  Timestamp. This tactic is used to detect incorrect sequences of events, primarily in distributed message-passing systems. A timestamp of an event can be established by assigning the state of a local clock to the event immediately after the event occurs. Sequence numbers can also be used for this purpose, since timestamps in a distributed system may be inconsistent across different processors. See [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17) for a fuller discussion of the topic of time in a distributed system.
