#### Resources Resources have syntax and semantics: *  Resource syntax. The syntax is the resource’s signature, which includes any information that another program will need to write a syntactically correct program that uses the resource. The signature includes the name of the resource, the names and data types of arguments, if any, and so forth. *  Resource semantics. What is the result of invoking this resource? Semantics come in a variety of guises, including the following: Assignment of values to data that the actor invoking the resource can access. The value assignment might be as simple as setting the value of a return argument or as far-reaching as updating a central database. Assumptions about the values crossing the interface. Changes in the element’s state brought about by using the resource. This includes exceptional conditions, such as side effects from a partially completed operation. Events that will be signaled or messages that will be sent as a result of using the resource.
