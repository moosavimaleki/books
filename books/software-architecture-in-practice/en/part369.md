—PC ### 10.5 For Further Reading To gain an appreciation for the importance of software safety, we suggest reading some of the disaster stories that arise when software fails. A venerable source is the ACM Risks Forum, available at [risks.org](http://risks.org). This has been moderated by Peter Neumann since 1985 and is still going strong. Two prominent standard safety processes are described in ARP-4761, “Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment,” developed by SAE International, and MIL STD 882E, “Standard Practice: System Safety,” developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Wu and Kelly [[Wu 04](ref01.xhtml#ref_257)] published a set of safety tactics in 2004, based on a survey of existing architectural approaches, which inspired much of the thinking in this chapter. Nancy Leveson is a thought leader in the area of software and safety. If you’re working in safety-critical systems, you should become familiar with her work. You can start small with a paper like [[Leveson 04](ref01.xhtml#ref_162)], which discusses a number of software-related factors that have contributed to spacecraft accidents. Or you can start at the top with [[Leveson 11](ref01.xhtml#ref_163)], a book that treats safety in the context of today’s complex, socio-technical, software-intensive systems.
