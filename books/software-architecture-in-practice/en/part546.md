![A graph of a long tail distribution of requests to AWS.](graphics/17fig03.jpg) Figure 17.3 Long tail distribution of 1,000 “launch instance” requests to AWS A scatter plot depicts the 1000 launch instance requests to ASW as a long tail distribution. The horizontal axis represents the return time in seconds ranging from 0 to 220 in increments of 20. The vertical axis represents the percent ranging from 0.0 to 16.0 in increments of 2.0. A cluster is shown between 20 and 40 seconds and 0.1 to 15.0 percent. A more close cluster is shown between 30 and 50 seconds and between 0.0 to 0.1 percent. Another loose cluster is shown between 150 and 200 seconds and between 0.0 and 0.1 percent. Here all the mentioned points are approximate. Long tail latencies are a result of congestion or failure somewhere in the path of the service request. Many factors may contribute to congestion—server queues, hypervisor scheduling, or others—but the cause of the congestion is out of your control as a service developer. Your monitoring techniques and your strategies to achieve your required performance and availability must reflect the reality of a long tail distribution.
