#### Power Monitor The power monitor pattern monitors and manages system devices, minimizing the time during which they are active. This pattern attempts to automatically disable devices and interfaces that are not being actively used by the application. It has long been used within integrated circuits, where blocks of the circuit are shut down when they are not being used, in an effort to save energy. Benefits: *  This pattern can allow for intelligent savings of power at little to no impact to the end user, assuming that the devices being shut down are truly not needed. Tradeoffs: *  Once a device has been switched off, switching it on adds some latency before it can respond, as compared with keeping it continually running. And, in some cases, the startup may be more energy expensive than a certain period of steady-state operation. *  The power monitor needs to have knowledge of each device and its energy consumption characteristics, which adds up-front complexity to the system design.
