All of these tactics add some capability or abstraction to the software that (were we not interested in testing) otherwise would not be there. They can be seen as augmenting bare-bones, get-the-job-done software with more elaborate software that has some special capabilities designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of testing. In addition to the testability tactics, a number of techniques are available for replacing one component with a different version of itself that facilitates testing: *  Component replacement simply swaps the implementation of a component with a different implementation that (in the case of testability) has features that facilitate testing. Component replacement is often accomplished in a systemâ€™s build scripts. *  Preprocessor macros, when activated, can expand to state-reporting code or activate probe statements that return or display information, or return control to a testing console. *  Aspects (in aspect-oriented programs) can handle the cross-cutting concern of how the state is reported.
