*  Pause/resume. When a user has initiated a long-running operation—say, downloading a large file or a set of files from a server—it is often useful to provide the ability to pause and resume the operation. Pausing a long-running operation may be done to temporarily free resources so that they may be reallocated to other tasks. *  Aggregate. When a user is performing repetitive operations, or operations that affect a large number of objects in the same way, it is useful to provide the ability to aggregate the lower-level objects into a single group, so that the operation may be applied to the group, thus freeing the user from the drudgery, and potential for mistakes, of doing the same operation repeatedly. An example is aggregating all of the objects in a slide and changing the text to 14-point font. #### Support System Initiative When the system takes the initiative, it must rely on a model of the user, a model of the task being undertaken by the user, or a model of the system state. Each model requires various types of input to accomplish its initiative. The support system initiative tactics identify the models the system uses to predict either its own behavior or the user’s intention. Encapsulating this information will make it easier to tailor or modify it. Tailoring and modification can either be dynamically based on past user behavior or happen offline during development. The relevant tactics are described here:
