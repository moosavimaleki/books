## 26 A Glimpse of the Future: Quantum Computing [A quantum computer can be compared] to the airplane the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk in 1903. The Wright Flyer barely got off the ground, but it foretold a revolution. —wired.com/2015/12/for-google-quantum-computing-is-like-learning-to-fly/ What will the future bring in terms of developments that affect the practice of software architecture? Humans are notoriously bad at predicting the long-term future, but we keep trying because, well, it’s fun. To close our book, we have chosen to focus on one particular aspect that is firmly rooted in the future but seems tantalizingly close to reality: quantum computing. Quantum computers will likely become practical over the next five to ten years. Consider that the system you are currently working on may have a lifetime on the order of tens—plural—of years. Code written in the 1960s and 1970s is still being used today on a daily basis. If the systems you are working on have lifetimes on that order, you may need to convert them to take advantage of quantum computer capabilities when quantum computers become practical.
