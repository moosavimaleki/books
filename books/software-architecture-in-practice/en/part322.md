*  Dynamic priority scheduling. Strategies include these: Round-robin. The round-robin scheduling strategy orders the requests and then, at every assignment possibility, assigns the resource to the next request in that order. A special form of round-robin is a cyclic executive, where possible assignment times are designated at fixed time intervals. Earliest-deadline-first. Earliest-deadline-first assigns priorities based on the pending requests with the earliest deadline. Least-slack-first. This strategy assigns the highest priority to the job having the least “slack time,” which is the difference between the execution time remaining and the time to the job’s deadline. For a single processor and processes that are preemptible, both the earliest-deadline-first and least-slack-first scheduling strategies are optimal choices. That is, if the set of processes can be scheduled so that all deadlines are met, then these strategies will be able to schedule that set successfully. *  Round-robin.
