By now, phase 2 was thrown off schedule to such an extent that the architect, to our horror, had to leave to fly back to his home in a distant city. He was none too happy that his architecture was going to be evaluated without him. The junior designers, he said, would never be able to answer our questions. Before his departure, our team huddled. The exercise seemed to be teetering on the brink of disaster. We had an unhappy departing architect, a blown schedule, and questionable expertise available. We decided to split our evaluation team. One half of the team would continue with phase 2 using the junior designers as our information resource. The second half of the team would continue with phase 2 by telephone the next day with the architect. Somehow we would make the best of a bad situation. Surprisingly, the project manager seemed completely unperturbed by the turn of events. “It will work out, I’m sure,” he said pleasantly, and then retreated to confer with various vice presidents about the reorganization.
