The publish-subscribe pattern has three types of elements: *  Publisher component. Sends (publishes) messages. *  Subscriber component. Subscribes to and then receives messages. *  Event bus. Manages subscriptions and message dispatch as part of the runtime infrastructure. Benefits: *  Publishers and subscribers are independent and hence loosely coupled. Adding or changing subscribers requires only registering for an event and causes no changes to the publisher. *  System behavior can be easily changed by changing the event or topic of a message being published, and consequently which subscribers might receive and act on this message. This seemingly small change can have large consequences, as features may be turned on or off by adding or suppressing messages. *  Events can be logged easily to allow for record and playback and thereby reproduce error conditions that can be challenging to recreate manually. Tradeoffs: *  Some implementations of the publish-subscribe pattern can negatively impact performance (latency). Use of a distributed coordination mechanism will ameliorate the performance degradation.
