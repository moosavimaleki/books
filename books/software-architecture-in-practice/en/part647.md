### 20.3 More on ADD Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts Most of the time you, as an architect, don’t need to, and should not, reinvent the wheel. Rather, your major design activity is to identify and select design concepts to meet the most important challenges and address the key drivers across the design iterations. Design is still an original and creative endeavor, but the creativity resides in the appropriate identification of these existing solutions, followed by combining and adapting them to the problem at hand. Even with an existing corpus of solutions to choose from—and we are not always blessed with a rich corpus—this is still the hardest part of design. #### Identification of Design Concepts The identification of design concepts might appear daunting, because of the vast number of options available. There are likely dozens of design patterns and externally developed components that you could use to address any particular issue. To make things worse, these design concepts are scattered across many different sources: in practitioner blogs and websites, in research literature, and in books. Moreover, in many cases, there is no canonical definition of a concept. Different sites, for example, will define the broker pattern in different, largely informal ways. Finally, once you have identified the alternatives that can potentially help you achieve the design goals of the iteration, you need to select the best one(s) for your purposes.
