Although the structures give different system perspectives, they are not independent. Elements of one structure will be related to elements of other structures, and we need to reason about these relations. For example, a module in a decomposition structure may be manifested as one, part of one, or several components in one of the C&C structures, reflecting its runtime alter-ego. In general, mappings between structures are many to many.
