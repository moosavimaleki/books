Figure 20.1 Overview of the architecture design activity A figure depicts the overview of the architecture design activity. An animated picture of a girl working in a system is shown at the center. She thinks about the candidate design decisions. This depiction is labeled as the architect. The architectural drivers such as design purpose, primary functionality, quality attributes, constraints, and architectural concerns are displayed vertically on the left of the architect. The architectural drivers gather to the architect. The design concepts such as reference architectures, externally developed components, tactics, and patterns are displayed horizontally above the architect. These design concepts select and instantiate the architect. The following structures are displayed vertically on the right of the architect: module that is divided into uses, decomposition, layered, class/generalization etcetera; component-and-connector that is divided into client-server, concurrency, process, shared data etcetera; and allocation that is divided into work assignment, deployment, implementation etcetera. The architect produces these structures.
