## Acknowledgments We are profoundly grateful to all the people with whom we collaborated to produce this book. First and foremost, we extend our gratitude to the co-authors of individual chapters. Their knowledge and insights in these areas were invaluable. Our thanks go to Cesare Pautasso of the Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano; Yazid Hamdi of Siemens Mobile Systems; Greg Hartman of Google; Humberto Cervantes of Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana—Iztapalapa; and Yuanfang Cai of Drexel University. Thanks to Eduardo Miranda of Carnegie Mellon University’s Institute for Software Research, who wrote the sidebar on the Value of Information technique. Good reviewers are essential to good work, and we are fortunate to have had John Hudak, Mario Benitez, Grace Lewis, Robert Nord, Dan Justice, and Krishna Guru lend their time and talents toward improving the material in this book. Thanks to James Ivers and Ipek Ozkaya for overseeing this book from the perspective of the SEI Series in Software Engineering.
