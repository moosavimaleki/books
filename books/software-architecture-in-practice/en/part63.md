2.  Unless your requirements are unprecedented—possible, but unlikely—your quality attributes should be achieved by using well-known architectural patterns and tactics (described in [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) through [13](ch13.xhtml#ch13)) specific to each attribute. 3.  The architecture should never depend on a particular version of a commercial product or tool. If it must, it should be structured so that changing to a different version is straightforward and inexpensive. 4.  Modules that produce data should be separate from modules that consume data. This tends to increase modifiability because changes are frequently confined to either the production or the consumption side of data. If new data is added, both sides will have to change, but the separation allows for a staged (incremental) upgrade. 5.  Don’t expect a one-to-one correspondence between modules and components. For example, in systems with concurrency, multiple instances of a component may be running in parallel, where each component is built from the same module. For systems with multiple threads of concurrency, each thread may use services from several components, each of which was built from a different module.
