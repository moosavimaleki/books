*  Coding. Secure Coding in C and C++[[Seacord 13](ref01.xhtml#ref_227)] describes how to code securely. *  Organizational processes. Organizations must have processes that take responsibility for various aspects of security, including ensuring that systems are upgraded to put into place the latest protections. NIST 800-53 provides an enumeration of organizational processes [[NIST 09](ref01.xhtml#ref_194)]. Organizational processes must account for insider threats, which account for 15–20 percent of attacks. [[Cappelli 12](ref01.xhtml#ref_50)] discusses insider threats. *  Technical processes. Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle includes modeling of threats: [microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=16420](http://microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=16420). The Common Weakness Enumeration is a list of the most common categories of vulnerabilities discovered in systems, including SQL injection and XSS: [https://cwe.mitre.org/](https://cwe.mitre.org/). NIST has published several volumes that give definitions of security terms [[NIST 04](ref01.xhtml#ref_192)], categories of security controls [[NIST 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_193)], and an enumeration of security controls that an organization could employ [[NIST 09](ref01.xhtml#ref_194)]. A security control could be a tactic, but it could also be organizational, coding, or technical in nature.
