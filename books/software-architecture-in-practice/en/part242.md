![A flowchart of integrability tactics.](graphics/07fig03.jpg) Figure 7.3 Integrability tactics The integrability tactics is depicted as a chart. The integrability tactics is divided into limit dependencies, adapt, and coordinate. The limit dependencies list the following: encapsulate, use an intermediary, restrict communication paths, adhere to standards, and abstract common services. The adapt lists the following: discover, tailor interface, and configure behavior. The coordinate lists the following: orchestrate and manage resources. #### Limit Dependencies ##### Encapsulate Encapsulation is the foundation upon which all other integrability tactics are built. It is therefore seldom seen on its own, but its use is implicit in the other tactics described here. Encapsulation introduces an explicit interface to an element and ensures that all access to the element passes through this interface. Dependencies on the element internals are eliminated, because all dependencies must flow through the interface. Encapsulation reduces the probability that a change to one element will propagate to other elements, by reducing either the number of dependencies or their distances. These strengths are, however, reduced because the interface limits the ways in which external responsibilities can interact with the element (perhaps through a wrapper). In consequence, the external responsibilities can only directly interact with the element through the exposed interface (indirect interactions, such as dependence on quality of service, will likely remain unchanged).
