![Illustration of a decomposition structure.](graphics/01fig05.jpg) Figure 1.5 A decomposition structure The structure of decomposition is presented. The windows apps package is shown inside the ATIA-M package. Inside the windows apps package, the following three packages are enclosed: common code for thick clients, TDDT windows app, and UTMC windows app. Inside the ATIA-M package and outside of the windows apps package, two packages are included, are ATIA server-side web modules and ATIA server-side Java modules. *  Uses structure. In this important but often overlooked structure, the units are also modules, and perhaps classes. The units are related by the uses relation, a specialized form of dependency. One unit of software uses another if the correctness of the first requires the presence of a correctly functioning version (as opposed to a stub) of the second. The uses structure is used to engineer systems that can be extended to add functionality, or from which useful functional subsets can be extracted. The ability to easily create a subset of a system allows for incremental development. This structure is also the basis for measuring social debt—the amount of communication that actually is, as opposed to merely should be, taking place among teams—as it defines which teams should be talking to each other. [Figure 1.6](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig06) shows a uses structure and highlights the modules that must be present in an increment if the module admin.client is present.
