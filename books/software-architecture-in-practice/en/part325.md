What is the point of this discussion? To paraphrase Gertrude Stein: Performance is performance is performance. Engineers have been analyzing and optimizing complex systems for centuries, trying to improve their performance, and they have been employing the same design strategies to do so. So you should feel some comfort in knowing that when you try to improve the performance of your computer-based system, you are applying tactics that have been thoroughly “road tested.” —RK ### 9.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Performance Based on the tactics described in [Section 9.2](ch09.xhtml#ch09lev1sec2), we can create a set of tactics-inspired questions, as presented in [Table 9.2](ch09.xhtml#ch09tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support performance, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
