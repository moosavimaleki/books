For each risk theme, the evaluation team identifies which of the business goals listed in step 2 are affected. Identifying risk themes and then relating them to specific drivers brings the evaluation full circle by relating the final results to the initial presentation, thereby providing a satisfying closure to the exercise. Equally important, it elevates the risks that were uncovered to the attention of management. What might otherwise have seemed to a manager like an esoteric technical issue is now identified unambiguously as a threat to something the manager is on record as caring about. The collected information from the evaluation is summarized and presented to stakeholders. The following outputs are presented: *  The architectural approaches documented *  The set of scenarios and their prioritization from the brainstorming *  The utility tree *  The risks and non-risks discovered *  The sensitivity points and tradeoffs found *  Risk themes and the business goals threatened by each one
