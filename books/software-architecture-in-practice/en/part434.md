### 13.2 Tactics for Usability [Figure 13.2](ch13.xhtml#ch13fig02) shows the goal of the set of usability tactics. ![The goal of usability tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is user interaction. The response is the user is given appropriate feedback and assistance.](graphics/13fig02.jpg) Figure 13.2 The goal of usability tactics #### Support User Initiative Once a system is executing, usability is enhanced by giving the user feedback about what the system is doing and by allowing the user to make appropriate responses. For example, the tactics described next—cancel, undo, pause/resume, and aggregate—support the user in either correcting errors or being more efficient. The architect designs a response for user initiative by enumerating and allocating the responsibilities of the system to respond to the user command. Here are some common examples of tactics to support user initiative: *  Cancel. When the user issues a cancel command, the system must be listening for it (thus there is the responsibility to have a constant listener that is not blocked by the actions of whatever is being canceled); the activity being canceled must be terminated; any resources being used by the canceled activity must be freed; and components that are collaborating with the canceled activity must be informed so that they can also take appropriate action.
