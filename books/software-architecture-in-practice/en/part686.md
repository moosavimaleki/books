*  Architecture stakeholders. Stakeholders have a vested interest in the architecture performing as advertised. They are the people whose ability to do their job hinges on the architecture promoting modifiability, security, high reliability, or the like. Stakeholders include developers, testers, integrators, maintainers, performance engineers, users, and builders of systems interacting with the one under consideration. Their job during an evaluation is to articulate the specific quality attribute goals that the architecture should meet for the system to be considered a success. A rule of thumb—and that is all it is—is that you should expect to enlist 10 to 25 stakeholders for the evaluation of a large enterprise-critical architecture. Unlike the evaluation team and the project decision makers, stakeholders do not participate in the entire exercise. #### Outputs of the ATAM 1.  A concise presentation of the architecture. One requirement of the ATAM is that the architecture be presented in one hour or less, which leads to an architectural presentation that is both concise and, usually, understandable.
