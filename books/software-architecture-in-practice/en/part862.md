A “QPU” will interact with a classic CPU in the same fashion that a graphic processing unit interacts with a CPU today. In other words, the CPU will view the QPU as a service to be provided with some input and that will produce some output. The communications between the CPU and the QPU will be in terms of classic bits. What the QPU does with the input to produce the output is outside of the scope of the CPU. A bit in a classic computer has a value of either 0 or 1 and, when functioning properly, there is no ambiguity about which value it assumes. Also, a bit in a classic computer has a nondestructive readout. That is, measuring the value will give you a 0 or a 1, and the bit will retain the value that it had when the read operation began. A qubit differs in both characteristics. A qubit is characterized by three numbers. Two of these numbers are probabilities: the probability that a measurement will deliver 1 and the probability that a measurement will deliver 0. The third number, called the phase, describes a rotation of the qubit. A measurement of a qubit will return either a 0 or a 1 (with probabilities as designated) and will destroy the current value of the qubit and replace it with the value that it returned. A qubit with non-zero probabilities for both 0 and 1 is said to be in superposition.
