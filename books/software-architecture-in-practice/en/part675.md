To be useful, the cost of evaluation needs to be less than the value it provides. Given this relationship, an important question is “How much time and money is the evaluation going to cost?” Different evaluation techniques come with different costs, but all of them can be measured in terms of the time spent by the people involved in the preparation, execution, and follow-up of the evaluation activities. ### 21.1 Evaluation as a Risk Reduction Activity Every architecture comes with risks. The output of an architecture evaluation includes an identification of risky portions of the architecture. A risk is an event that has both an impact and a probability. The estimated cost of a risk is the probability of that event occurring multiplied by the cost of the impact. Fixing those risks is not an output of the evaluation. Once the risks have been identified, then fixing them is, like the evaluation itself, a cost/benefit issue.
