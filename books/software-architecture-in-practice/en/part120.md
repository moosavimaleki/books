While we discuss patterns and tactics as though they were foundational design decisions, the reality is that architectures often emerge and evolve as a result of many small decisions and business forces. For example, a system that was once tolerably modifiable may deteriorate over time, through the actions of developers adding features and fixing bugs. Similarly, a system’s performance, availability, security, and any other quality may (and typically does) deteriorate over time, again through the well-intentioned actions of programmers who are focused on their immediate tasks and not on preserving architectural integrity. This “death by a thousand cuts” is common on software projects. Developers may make suboptimal decisions due to a lack of understanding of the structures of the system, schedule pressures, or perhaps a lack of clarity in the architecture from the start. This kind of deterioration is a form of technical debt known as architecture debt. We discuss architecture debt in [Chapter 23](ch23.xhtml#ch23). To reverse this debt, we typically refactor.
