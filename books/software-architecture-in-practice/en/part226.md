Does the system schedule resources to more effectively utilize energy, given task constraints and respecting task priorities, by switching computational resources, such as service providers, to the ones that offer better energy efficiency or lower energy costs? Is scheduling based on data collected (using one or more resource monitoring tactics) about the state of the system? Does the system make use of a discovery service to match service requests to service providers? In the context of energy efficiency, a service request could be annotated with energy requirement information, allowing the requestor to choose a service provider based on its (possibly dynamic) energy characteristics. Reduce Resource Demand Do you consistently attempt to reduce resource demand? Here, you may insert the questions in this category from the Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Performance from [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09). ### 6.4 Patterns Some examples of patterns used for energy efficiency include sensor fusion, kill abnormal tasks, and power monitor.
