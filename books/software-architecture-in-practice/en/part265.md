*  What is the cost of the change? Making a system more modifiable involves two types of costs: The cost of introducing the mechanism(s) to make the system more modifiable The cost of making the modification using the mechanism(s) *  The cost of introducing the mechanism(s) to make the system more modifiable *  The cost of making the modification using the mechanism(s) For example, the simplest mechanism for making a change is to wait for a change request to come in, then change the source code to accommodate the request. In such a case, the cost of introducing the mechanism is zero (since there is no special mechanism); the cost of exercising it is the cost of changing the source code and revalidating the system. Toward the other end of the spectrum is an application generator, such as a user interface builder. The builder takes as input a description of the designed UI produced through direct manipulation techniques and which may then produce source code. The cost of introducing the mechanism is the cost of acquiring the UI builder, which may be substantial. The cost of using the mechanism is the cost of producing the input to feed the builder (this cost can be either substantial or negligible), the cost of running the builder (close to zero), and finally the cost of whatever testing is performed on the result (usually much less than for hand-coding).
