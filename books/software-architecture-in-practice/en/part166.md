Other patterns for availability include the following. *  The benefit of a redundant spare is a system that continues to function correctly after only a brief delay in the presence of a failure. The alternative is a system that stops functioning correctly, or stops functioning altogether, until the failed component is repaired. This repair could take hours or days. *  The tradeoff with any of these patterns is the additional cost and complexity incurred in providing a spare. *  The tradeoff among the three alternatives is the time to recover from a failure versus the runtime cost incurred to keep a spare up-to-date. A hot spare carries the highest cost but leads to the fastest recovery time, for example. *  Triple modular redundancy (TMR). This widely used implementation of the voting tactic employs three components that do the same thing. Each component receives identical inputs and forwards its output to the voting logic, which detects any inconsistency among the three output states. Faced with an inconsistency, the voter reports a fault. It must also decide which output to use, and different instantiations of this pattern use different decision rules. Typical choices are letting the majority rule or choosing some computed average of the disparate outputs.
