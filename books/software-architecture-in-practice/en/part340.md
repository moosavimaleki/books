## 10 Safety Giles: Well, for god’s sake, be careful. . . . If you should be hurt or killed, shall take it amiss.Willow: Well, we try not to get killed. That’s part of our whole mission statement: Don’t get killed.Giles: Good. —Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Season 3, episode “Anne” “Don’t kill anyone” should be a part of every software architect’s mission statement. The thought that software could kill people or cause injury or damage used to belong solidly in the realm of computers-run-amok science fiction; think of HAL politely declining to open the pod bay doors in the now-aged but still-classic movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, leaving Dave stranded in space. Sadly, it didn’t stay there. As software has come to control more and more of the devices in our lives, software safety has become a critical concern. The thought that software (strings of 0s and 1s) can kill or maim or destroy is still an unnatural notion. To be fair, it’s not the 0s and 1s that wreak havoc—at least, not directly. It’s what they’re connected to. Software, and the computer in which it runs, has to be connected to the outside world in some way before it can do damage. That’s the good news. The bad news is that the good news isn’t all that good. Software is connected to the outside world, always. If your program has no effect whatsoever that is observable outside of itself, it probably serves no purpose.
