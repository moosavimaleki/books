*  Undo. To support the ability to undo, the system must maintain a sufficient amount of information about system state so that an earlier state may be restored, at the user’s request. Such a record may take the form of state “snapshots”—for example, checkpoints—or a set of reversible operations. Not all operations can be easily reversed. For example, changing all occurrences of the letter “a” to the letter “b” in a document cannot be reversed by changing all instances of “b” to “a”, because some of those instances of “b” may have existed prior to the original change. In such a case, the system must maintain a more elaborate record of the change. Of course, some operations cannot be undone at all: You can’t unship a package or unfire a missile, for example. Undo comes in flavors. Some systems allow a single undo (where invoking undo again reverts you to the state in which you commanded the first undo, essentially undoing the undo). In other systems, commanding multiple undo operations steps you back through many previous states, either up to some limit or all the way back to the time when the application was last opened.
