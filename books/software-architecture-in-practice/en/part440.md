#### Model-View-Controller MVC is likely the most widely known pattern for usability. It comes in many variants, such as MVP (model-view-presenter), MVVM (model-view-view-model), MVA (model-view-adapter), and so forth. Essentially all of these patterns are focused on separating the model—the underlying “business” logic of the system—from its realization in one or more UI views. In the original MVC model, the model would send updates to a view, which a user would see and interact with. User interactions—key presses, button clicks, mouse motions, and so forth—are transmitted to the controller, which interprets them as operations on the model and then sends those operations to the model, which changes its state in response. The reverse path was also a portion of the original MVC pattern. That is, the model might be changed and the controller would send updates to the view. The sending of updates depends on whether the MVC is in one process or is distributed across processes (and potentially across the network). If the MVC is in one process, then the updates are sent using the observer pattern (discussed in the next subsection). If the MVC is distributed across processes, then the publish-subscribe pattern is often used to send updates (see [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08)).
