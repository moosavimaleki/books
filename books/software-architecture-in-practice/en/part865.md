2.  A NOT operation takes a qubit in superposition and flips the amplitudes. That is, the probability of the resulting qubit being 0 is the original probability of it being 1, and vice versa. 3.  A Z operation adds Π to the phase of the qubit (modulo 2Π). 4.  A HAD (short for Hadamard) operation creates an equal superposition, which means the amplitudes of qubits with value 0 and 1, respectively, are equal. A 0 input value generates a phase of 0 radians, and a 1 input value generates a phase of Π radians. It is possible to chain multiple operations together to produce more sophisticated units of functionality. Some operators work on more than one qubit. The primary two-qubit operator is CNOT—a controlled not. The first qubit is the control bit. If it is 1, then the operation performs a NOT on the second qubit. If the first qubit is 0, then the second qubit remains unchanged.
