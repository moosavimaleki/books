*  Observers may need to do considerable work to determine if and how to reflect a state update, and this work may be repeated for each observer. For example, suppose the subject is changing its state at a fine granularity, such as a temperature sensor that reports 1/100th degree fluctuations, but the view updates changes only in full degrees. In such cases where there is an “impedance mismatch,” substantial processing resources may be wasted. #### Memento The memento pattern is a common way to implement the undo tactic. This pattern features three major components: the originator, the caretaker, and the memento. The originator is processing some stream of events that change its state (originating from user interaction). The caretaker is sending events to the originator that cause it to change its state. When the caretaker is about to change the state of the originator, it can request a memento—a snapshot of the existing state—and can use this artifact to restore that existing state if needed, by simply passing the memento back to the originator. In this way, the caretaker knows nothing about how state is managed; the memento is simply an abstraction that the caretaker employs.
