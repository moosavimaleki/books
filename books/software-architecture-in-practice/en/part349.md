*  Avoid the unsafe state *  Recover *  Continue in degraded or safe mode *  Shut down *  Switch to manual operation *  Switch to a backup system *  Notify appropriate entities (people or systems) *  Log the unsafe state (and the response to it) Response measure Time to return to safe state space; damage or injury caused One or more of the following: *  Amount or percentage of entries into unsafe states that are avoided *  Amount or percentages of unsafe states from which the system can (automatically) recover *  Change in risk exposure: size(loss) * prob(loss) *  Percentage of time the system can recover *  Amount of time the system is in a degraded or safe mode *  Amount or percentage of time the system is shut down *  Elapsed time to enter and recover (from manual operation, from a safe or degraded mode) A sample safety scenario is: A sensor in the patient monitoring system fails to report a life-critical value after 100 ms. The failure is logged, a warning light is illuminated on the console, and a backup (lower-fidelity) sensor is engaged. The system monitors the patient using the backup sensor after no more than 300 ms. [Figure 10.1](ch10.xhtml#ch10fig01) illustrates this scenario.
