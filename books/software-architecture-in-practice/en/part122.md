Successfully achieving quality attributes often involves process-related decisions, in addition to architecture-related decisions. For example, a great security architecture is worthless if your employees are susceptible to phishing attacks or do not choose strong passwords. We are not dealing with the process aspects in this book, but be aware that they are important. ### 3.5 Designing with Tactics A system design consists of a collection of decisions. Some of these decisions help control the quality attribute responses; others ensure achievement of system functionality. We depict this relationship in [Figure 3.3](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig03). Tactics, like patterns, are design techniques that architects have been using for years. In this book, we isolate, catalog, and describe them. We are not inventing tactics here, but rather just capturing what good architects do in practice. ![A figure shows the tactics to control response in a square block. A right arrow touching the left side of the block is labeled as a stimulus. A right arrow from the right end of the block is labeled as a response.](graphics/03fig03.jpg)
