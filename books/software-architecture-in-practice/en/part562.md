Autoscaling is an infrastructure service that automatically creates new instances when needed and releases surplus instances when they are no longer needed. It usually works in conjunction with load balancing to grow and shrink the pool of service instances behind a load balancer. Autoscaling containers is slightly different from autoscaling VMs. We discuss autoscaling VMs first and then discuss the differences when containers are being autoscaled. ##### Autoscaling VMs Returning to [Figure 17.4](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig04), suppose that the two clients generate more requests than can be handled by the two service instances shown. Autoscaling creates a third instance, based on the same virtual machine image that was used for the first two instances. The new instance is registered with the load balancer so that subsequent requests are distributed among three instances rather than two. [Figure 17.5](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig05) shows a new component, the autoscaler, that monitors and autoscales the utilization of the server instances. Once the autoscaler creates a new service instance, it notifies the load balancer of the new IP address so that the load balancer can distribute requests to the new instance, in addition to the requests it distributes to the other instances.
