XML documents are used as representations of structured data for many purposes: for messages exchanged in a distributed system (SOAP), the content of web pages (XHTML), vector images (SVG), business documents (DOCX), web service interface description (WSDL), and static configuration files (e.g., MacOS property lists). One strength of XML is that a document annotated using this language can be checked to validate that it conforms to a schema. This prevents faults caused by malformed documents and eliminates the need for some kinds of error checking by the code that reads and processes the document. The tradeoff is that parsing the document and validating it are relatively expensive in terms of processing and memory. A document must be read completely before it can be validated and may require multiple read passes to unmarshal. This requirement, coupled with XML’s verbosity, can result in unacceptable runtime performance and bandwidth consumption. While during XML’s heyday the argument was often made that “XML is human readable,” today this benefit is cited far less often.
