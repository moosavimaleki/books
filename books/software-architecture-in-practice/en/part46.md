![The layer structure is depicted.](graphics/01fig07.jpg) Figure 1.7 Layer structure A chart shows the structure of layers. The user-level layer user programs are allowed to use the user-level layer libraries and kernel-level layer system call interface. The libraries in turn are allowed to use the system call interface. The system call interface is allowed to use the kernel-level layers file subsystem and process control subsystem (IPC, scheduler, memory management). The file subsystem is allowed to use the kernel-level layers character device drivers and buffering mechanism. Buffering mechanism in turn is allowed to use block I/O device drivers. The process control subsystem is allowed to use the kernel-level layer hardware control. Similarly, the character device drivers and block I/O device drivers are allowed to use the hardware control. The key for the structure is provided below. The user-level layers are represented by a lightly shaded rectangle whereas the kernel-level layers are represented by a dark shaded rectangle. The down arrow from each layer represents "allowed to use".
