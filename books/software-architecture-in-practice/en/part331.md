Benefits: *  By throttling incoming requests, you can gracefully handle variations in demand. In doing so, services never become overloaded; they can be kept in a performance “sweet spot” where they handle requests efficiently. Tradeoffs: *  The throttling logic must be very fast; otherwise, it may itself contribute to performance problems. *  If client demand regularly exceeds capacity, buffers will need to be very large, or there is a risk of losing requests. *  This pattern can be difficult to add to an existing system where clients and servers are tightly coupled. #### Map-Reduce The map-reduce pattern efficiently performs a distributed and parallel sort of a large data set and provides a simple means for the programmer to specify the analysis to be done. Unlike our other patterns for performance, which are independent of any application, the map-reduce pattern is specifically designed to bring high performance to a specific kind of recurring problem: sort and analyze a large data set. This problem is experienced by any organization dealing with massive data—think Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Netflix—and all of these organizations do in fact use map-reduce.
