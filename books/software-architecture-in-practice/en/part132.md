One of the most demanding tasks in building a high-availability fault-tolerant system is to understand the nature of the failures that can arise during operation. Once those are understood, mitigation strategies can be designed into the system. Since a system failure is observable by users, the time to repair is the time until the failure is no longer observable. This may be an imperceptible delay in a user’s response time or it may be the time it takes someone to fly to a remote location in the Andes to repair a piece of mining machinery (as was recounted to us by a person responsible for repairing the software in a mining machine engine). The notion of “observability” is critical here: If a failure could have been observed, then it is a failure, whether or not it was actually observed. In addition, we are often concerned with the level of capability that remains when a failure has occurred—a degraded operating mode.
