*  Authorize actors. Authorization means ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or services. This mechanism is usually enabled by providing some access control mechanisms within a system. Access control can be assigned per actor, per actor class, or per role. *  Limit access. This tactic involves limiting access to computer resources. Limiting access might mean restricting the number of access points to the resources, or restricting the type of traffic that can go through the access points. Both kinds of limits minimize the attack surface of a system. For example, a demilitarized zone (DMZ) is used when an organization wants to let external users access certain services but not access other services. The DMZ sits between the Internet and an intranet, and is protected by a pair of firewalls, one on either side. The internal firewall is a single point of access to the intranet; it functions as a limit to the number of access points as well as controls the type of traffic allowed through to the intranet.
