Network isolation is achieved through the identification of messages. Every virtual machine (VM) or container has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is used to identify messages to or from that VM or container. In essence, the IP address is used to route responses to the correct VM or container. Another network mechanism for sending and receiving messages relies on the use of ports. Every message intended for a service has a port number associated with it. A service listens on a port and receives messages that arrive at the device on which the service is executing designated for the port on which the service is listening. ### 16.2 Virtual Machines Now that we have seen how the resource usage of one application can be isolated from the resource usage of another application, we can employ and combine these mechanisms. Virtual machines allow the execution of multiple simulated, or virtual, computers in a single physical computer.
