*  The (maximum, minimum, mean, median) time the response takes (latency) *  The number or percentage of satisfied requests over some time interval (throughput) or set of events received *  The number or percentage of requests that go unsatisfied *  The variation in response time (jitter) *  Usage level of a computing resource [Figure 9.1](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig01) gives an example concrete performance scenario: Five hundred users initiate 2,000 requests in a 30-second interval, under normal operations. The system processes all of the requests with an average latency of two seconds. ![A sample performance scenario is presented.](graphics/09fig01.jpg) Figure 9.1 Sample performance scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is 500 users. The stimulus is to initiate 2,000 requests in a 30-second interval. The artifact is the system. The environment is the normal operations. The response is to processes all requests. The response measure is the average latency of 2 seconds.
