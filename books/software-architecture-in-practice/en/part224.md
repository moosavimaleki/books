### 6.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Energy Efficiency As described in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03), this tactics-based questionnaire is intended to very quickly understand the degree to which an architecture employs specific tactics to manage energy efficiency. Based on the tactics described in [Section 6.2](ch06.xhtml#ch06lev1sec2), we can create a set of tactics-inspired questions, as presented in [Table 6.2](ch06.xhtml#ch06tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support energy efficiency, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.

That is, does the system collect data about the actual energy consumption of computational devices via a sensor infrastructure, in near real time?
