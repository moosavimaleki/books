We now turn to the specifics of designing particular interfaces. This means deciding which operations, events, and properties it should feature. Additionally, you must choose suitable data representation formats and data semantics to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of your architectural elements with each other. Our opening quotation gives one example of the importance of these decisions. #### Interaction Styles Interfaces are meant to be connected together so that different elements can communicate (transfer data) and coordinate (transfer control). There are many ways for such interactions to take place, depending on the mix between communication and coordination, and on whether the elements will be co-located or remotely deployed. For example: *  Interfaces of co-located elements may provide efficient access to large quantities of data via local shared memory buffers. *  Elements that are expected to be available at the same time can use synchronous calls to invoke the operations they require.
