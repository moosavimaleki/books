—LB Testing is carried out by various developers, users, or quality assurance personnel. Either portions of the system or the entire system may be tested. The response measures for testability deal with how effective the tests are in discovering faults and how long it takes to perform the tests to some desired level of coverage. Test cases can be written by the developers, the testing group, or the customer. In some cases, testing actually drives development, as is the case with test-driven development. Testing of code is a special case of validation, which entails making sure that an engineered artifact meets its stakeholders’ needs or is suitable for use. In [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21), we will discuss architectural design reviews—another kind of validation, in which the artifact being tested is the architecture. ### 12.1 Testability General Scenario [Table 12.1](ch12.xhtml#ch12tab01) enumerates the elements of the general scenario that characterize testability.
