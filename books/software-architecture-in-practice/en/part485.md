*  Representational State Transfer (REST). REST is a protocol for web services. It grew out of the original protocol used when the World Wide Web was introduced. REST comprises a set of six constraints imposed on the interactions between elements: Uniform interface. All interactions use the same form (typically HTTP). Resources on the providing side of the interface are specified via URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Naming conventions should be consistent and, in general, the principle of least surprise should be followed. Client-server. The actors are clients and the resource providers are servers using the client-server pattern. Stateless. All client-server interactions are stateless. That is, the client should not assume that the server has retained any information about the clientâ€™s last request. In consequence, interactions such as authorization are encoded into a token and the token is passed with each request. Cacheable. Caching is applied to resources when applicable. Caching can be implemented on the server side or the client side.
