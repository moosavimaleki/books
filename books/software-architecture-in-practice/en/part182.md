A lot of time was spent trying to figure out why a test that passed in one environment failed in another environment. One benefit of environments that employ virtualization is the ability to have environment parity, where environments may differ in scale but not in type of hardware or fundamental structure. A variety of provisioning tools support environment parity by allowing every team to easily build a common environment and by ensuring that this common environment mimics the production environment as closely as possible. Three important ways to measure the quality of the pipeline are as follows: *  Cycle time is the pace of progress through the pipeline. Many organizations will deploy to production several or even hundreds of times a day. Such rapid deployment is not possible if human intervention is required. It is also not possible if one team must coordinate with other teams before placing its service in production. Later in this chapter, we will see architectural techniques that allow teams to perform continuous deployment without consulting other teams.
