In principle, an outside team may evaluate a completed architecture, an incomplete architecture, or a portion of an architecture. In practice, because engaging them is complicated and often expensive, they tend to be used to evaluate complete architectures. ### 21.4 Contextual Factors For peer reviews or outside analysis, a number of contextual factors must be considered when setting up an evaluation: *  What artifacts are available? To perform an architectural evaluation, there must be an artifact that both describes the architecture and is readily available. Some evaluations may take place after the system is operational. In this case, some architecture recovery and analysis tools may be used to assist in discovering the architecture, to find architecture design flaws, and to test that the as-built system conforms to the as-designed system. *  Who sees the results? Some evaluations are performed with the full knowledge and participation of all of the stakeholders. Others are performed more privately.
