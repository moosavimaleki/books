# DevOps DevOps—a portmanteau of “development” and “operations”—is a concept closely associated with continuous deployment. It is a movement (much like the Agile movement), a description of a set of practices and tools (again, much like the Agile movement), and a marketing formula touted by vendors selling those tools. The goal of DevOps is to shorten time to market (or time to release). The goal is to dramatically shorten the time between a developer making a change to an existing system—implementing a feature or fixing a bug—and the system reaching the hands of end users, as compared with traditional software development practices. A formal definition of DevOps captures both the frequency of releases and the ability to perform bug fixes on demand: DevOps is a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.
