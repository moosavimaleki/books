A successful interaction with an interface requires agreement on the following aspects: 1.  Interface scope 2.  Interaction style 3.  Representation and structure of the exchanged data 4.  Error handling Each of these constitutes an important aspect of designing an interface. We’ll cover each in turn. #### Interface Scope The scope of an interface defines the collection of resources directly available to the actors. You, as an interface designer, might want to reveal all resources; alternatively, you might wish to constrain the access to certain resources or to certain actors. For example, you might want to constrain access for reasons of security, performance management, and extensibility. A common pattern for constraining and mediating access to resources of an element or a group of elements is to establish a gateway element. A gateway—often called a message gateway—translates actor requests into requests to the target element’s (or elements’) resources, and so becomes an actor for the target element or elements. [Figure 15.2](ch15.xhtml#ch15fig02) provides an example of a gateway. Gateways are useful for the following reasons:
