Table 9.2 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Performance Tactics Group Tactics Question Supported?(Y/N) Risk Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Control Resource Demand Do you have in place a service level agreement (SLA) that specifies the maximum event arrival rate that you are willing to support? Can you manage the rate at which you sample events arriving at the system? How will the system limit the response (amount of processing) for an event? Have you defined different categories of requests and defined priorities for each category? Can you reduce computational overhead by, for example, co-location, cleaning up resources, or reducing indirection? Can you bound the execution time of your algorithms? Can you increase computational efficiency through your choice of algorithms? Manage Resources Can you allocate more resources to the system or its components? Are you employing concurrency? If requests can be processed in parallel, the blocked time can be reduced. Can computations be replicated on different processors?
