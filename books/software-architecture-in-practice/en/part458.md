Use standard lists of QAs to the extent that they are helpful as checklists, but don’t feel the need to slavishly adhere to their terminology or structure. And don’t fool yourself that such a checklist removes the need for deeper analysis. ### 14.3 Dealing with “X-Ability”: Bringing a New QA into the Fold Suppose, as an architect, you had to deal with a QA for which there is no compact body of knowledge, no “portfolio” like [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[13](ch13.xhtml#ch13) provided for those QAs. Suppose you find yourself having to deal with a QA like “development distributability” or “manageability” or even “Iowability”? What do you do? #### Capture Scenarios for the New Quality Attribute The first step is to interview the stakeholders whose concerns have led to the need for this QA. You can work with them, either individually or as a group, to build a set of attribute characterizations that refine what is meant by the QA. For example, you might decompose development distributability into the subattributes of software segmentation, software composition, and team coordination. After that refinement, you can work with the stakeholders to craft a set of specific scenarios that characterize what is meant by that QA. An example of this process can be found in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22), where we describe building a “utility tree.”
