Location in the vehicle. First-class passengers may have better Wi-Fi connectivity than second-class passengers. Connectivity. Some functions may be split among several ECUs. If so, they must be on the same internal network and able to communicate with each other. Locality of communication. Putting components that intensely communicate with each other on the same ECU will improve their performance and reduce network traffic. Cost. Typically a manufacturer wants to minimize the number of ECUs deployed. *  Fit of the ECU to the function. Functions must be allocated to ECUs with sufficient power to perform the function. Some ECUs may have specialized processors; for example, an ECU with a graphics processor is a better fit for graphics functions. *  Criticality. More powerful ECUs may be reserved for critical functions. For example, engine controllers are more critical and more reliable than the comfort features subsystem. *  Location in the vehicle.
