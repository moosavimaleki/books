### 7.1 Evaluating the Integrability of an Architecture Integration difficulty—the costs and the technical risks—can be thought of as a function of the size of and the “distance” between the interfaces of {Ci} and S: Size is the number of potential dependencies between {Ci} and S. Distance is the difficulty of resolving differences at each of the dependencies. Dependencies are often measured syntactically. For example, we say that module A is dependent on component B if A calls B, if A inherits from B, or if A uses B. But while syntactic dependency is important, and will continue to be important in the future, dependency can occur in forms that are not detectable by any syntactic relation. Two components might be coupled temporally or through resources because they share and compete for a finite resource at runtime (e.g., memory, bandwidth, CPU), share control of an external device, or have a timing dependency. Or they might be coupled semantically because they share knowledge of the same protocol, file format, unit of measure, metadata, or some other aspect. The reason that these distinctions are important is that temporal and semantic dependencies are not often well understood, explicitly acknowledged, or properly documented. Missing or implicit knowledge is always a risk for a large, long-lived project, and such knowledge gaps will inevitably increase the costs and risks of integration and integration testing.
