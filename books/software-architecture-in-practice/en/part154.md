*  Escalating restart. This reintroduction tactic allows the system to recover from faults by varying the granularity of the component(s) restarted and minimizing the level of service affectation. For example, consider a system that supports four levels of restart, numbered 0â€“3. The lowest level of restart (Level 0) has the least impact on services and employs passive redundancy (warm spare), where all child threads of the faulty component are killed and recreated. In this way, only data associated with the child threads is freed and reinitialized. The next level of restart (Level 1) frees and reinitializes all unprotected memory; protected memory is untouched. The next level of restart (Level 2) frees and reinitializes all memory, both protected and unprotected, forcing all applications to reload and reinitialize. The final level of restart (Level 3) involves completely reloading and reinitializing the executable image and associated data segments. Support for the escalating restart tactic is particularly useful for the concept of graceful degradation, where a system is able to degrade the services it provides while maintaining support for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.
