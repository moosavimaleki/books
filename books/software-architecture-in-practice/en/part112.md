In the next three sections, we focus on how quality attributes can be specified, what architectural decisions will enable the achievement of particular quality attributes, and what questions about quality attributes will enable the architect to make the correct design decisions. ### 3.3 Specifying Quality Attribute Requirements: Quality Attribute Scenarios We use a common form to specify all QA requirements as scenarios. This addresses the vocabulary problems we identified previously. The common form is testable and unambiguous; it is not sensitive to whims of categorization. Thus it provides regularity in how we treat all quality attributes. Quality attribute scenarios have six parts: *  Stimulus. We use the term “stimulus” to describe an event arriving at the system or the project. The stimulus can be an event to the performance community, a user operation to the usability community, or an attack to the security community, and so forth. We use the same term to describe a motivating action for developmental qualities. Thus a stimulus for modifiability is a request for a modification; a stimulus for testability is the completion of a unit of development.
