*  Static classification. Sometimes real-time data collection is infeasible. For example, if an organization is using an off-premises cloud, it might not have direct access to real-time energy data. Static classification allows us to estimate energy consumption by cataloging the computing resources used and their known energy characteristics—the amount of energy used by a memory device per fetch, for example. These characteristics are available as benchmarks, or from manufacturers’ specifications. *  Dynamic classification. In cases where a static model of a computational resource is inadequate, a dynamic model might be required. Unlike static models, dynamic models estimate energy consumption based on knowledge of transient conditions such as workload. The model could be a simple table lookup, a regression model based on data collected during prior executions, or a simulation. #### Allocate Resources Resource allocation means assigning resources to do work in a way that is mindful of energy consumption. The tactics for resource allocation are to reduce usage, discovery, and scheduling.
