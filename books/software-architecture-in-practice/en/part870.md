What this means is that given a message encrypted based on the primes p and q, decrypting this message is relatively easy if you know p and q but practically impossible if you don’t—at least on a classical computer. Quantum computers, however, can factor pq much more efficiently than classical computers. Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can factor pq with running time on the order of log (number of bits in p and q). ### 26.4 Other Algorithms Quantum computing holds similar game-changing potential for many applications. Here, we begin our discussion by introducing a necessary but currently nonexistent piece of hardware—QRAM. #### QRAM Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a critical element for implementing and applying many quantum algorithms. QRAM, or something similar, will be necessary to provide efficient access to large amounts of data such as that used in machine learning applications. Currently, no implementation of QRAM exists, but several research groups are exploring how such an implementation could work.
