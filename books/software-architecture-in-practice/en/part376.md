*  Availability is the property that the system will be available for legitimate use. For example, a denial-of-service attack won’t prevent you from ordering this book from an online bookstore. We will use these characteristics in our general scenario for security. One technique that is used in the security domain is threat modeling. An “attack tree,” which is similar to the fault tree discussed in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04), is used by security engineers to determine possible threats. The root of the tree is a successful attack, and the nodes are possible direct causes of that successful attack. Children nodes decompose the direct causes, and so forth. An attack is an attempt to compromise CIA, with the leaves of attack trees being the stimulus in the scenario. The response to the attack is to preserve CIA or deter attackers through monitoring of their activities. # Privacy An issue closely related to security is the quality of privacy. Privacy concerns have become more important in recent years and are enshrined into law in the European Union through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Other jurisdictions have adopted similar regulations.
