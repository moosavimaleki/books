8. Development-time tactics have to do with separating and encapsulating responsibilities. Performance tactics have to do with putting things together. That is why they are perpetually in conflict. Must it always be so? Is there a principled way of quantifying the tradeoffs? 9. Is there a taxonomy of tactics? Chemists have the periodic table and laws of molecular interaction, atomic physicists have their catalogs of subatomic particles and laws for what happens when they collide, pharmacologists have their catalogs of chemicals and laws for their interactions with receptors and metabolic systems, and so forth. What is the equivalent for tactics? And are there laws for their interaction? 10. Security is a QA that is especially sensitive to processes that take place in the physical world outside the computer: processes for applying patches, processes for choosing and safeguarding your passwords, processes for physically securing the installations where computers and data live, processes for deciding whether to trust a piece of imported software, processes for deciding whether to trust a human developer or user, and so forth. What are the corresponding processes that are important for performance? Or usability? Are there any? Why is security so process-sensitive? Should processes be a portion of the QA structure or are they orthogonal to it?
