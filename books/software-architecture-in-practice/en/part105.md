We have been using the term “quality attribute” loosely, but now it is time to define it more carefully. A quality attribute (QA) is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders beyond the basic function of the system. You can think of a quality attribute as measuring the “utility” of a product along some dimension of interest to a stakeholder. In this chapter our focus is on understanding the following: *  How to express the qualities we want our architecture to exhibit *  How to achieve the qualities through architectural means *  How to determine the design decisions we might make with respect to the qualities This chapter provides the context for the discussions of individual quality attributes in [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[14](ch14.xhtml#ch14). ### 3.1 Functionality Functionality is the ability of the system to do the work for which it was intended. Of all of the requirements, functionality has the strangest relationship to architecture.
