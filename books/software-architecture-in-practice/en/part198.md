[4](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn4). At Amazon, service teams are constrained in size by the “two pizza rule”: The team must be no larger than can be fed by two pizzas. Benefits: *  Time to market is reduced. Since each service is small and independently deployable, a modification to a service can be deployed without coordinating with teams that own other services. Thus, once a team completes its work on a new version of a service and that version has been tested, it can be deployed immediately. *  Each team can make its own technology choices for its service, as long as the technology choices support message passing. No coordination is needed with respect to library versions or programming languages. This reduces errors due to incompatibilities that arise during integration—and which are a major source of integration errors. *  Services are more easily scaled than coarser-grained applications. Since each service is independent, dynamically adding instances of the service is straightforward. In this way, the supply of services can be more easily matched to the demand.
