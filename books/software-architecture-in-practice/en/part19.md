Third, the meteoric growth (and unprecedented levels of employee turnover) that characterizes the world of information systems means that no one understands everything in any real-world system. Just being smart and working hard aren’t good enough. Fourth, despite having tools that automate much of what we used to do ourselves—think about all of the orchestration, deployment, and management functions baked into Kubernetes, for example—we still need to understand the quality attribute properties of these systems that we depend upon, and we need to understand the emergent quality attribute properties when we combine systems together. Most quality attributes—performance, security, availability, safety, and so on—are susceptible to “weakest link” problems, and those weakest links may only emerge and bite us when we compose systems. Without a guiding hand to ward off disaster, the composition is very likely to fail. That guiding hand belongs to an architect, regardless of their title. Given these considerations, we felt safe and secure that there was indeed a need for this book.
