*  Redistribute responsibilities. If responsibilities A, A′, and A″ (all similar responsibilities) are sprinkled across several distinct modules, they should be placed together. This refactoring may involve creating a new module, or it may involve moving responsibilities to existing modules. One method for identifying responsibilities to be moved is to hypothesize a set of likely changes as scenarios. If the scenarios consistently affect just one part of a module, then perhaps the other parts have separate responsibilities and should be moved. Alternatively, if some scenarios require modifications to multiple modules, then perhaps the responsibilities affected should be grouped together into a new module. #### Reduce Coupling We now turn to tactics that reduce the coupling between modules. These tactics overlap with the integrability tactics described in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07), because reducing dependencies among independent components (for integrability) is similar to reducing coupling among modules (for modifiability). *  Encapsulate. See the discussion in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07).
