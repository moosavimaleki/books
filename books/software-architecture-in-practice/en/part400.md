## 12 Testability Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding. —Burt Rutan A substantial portion of the cost of developing well-engineered systems is taken up by testing. If a carefully thought-out software architecture can reduce this cost, the payoff is large. Software testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through (typically execution-based) testing. Specifically, testability refers to the probability, assuming that the software has at least one fault, that it will fail on its next test execution. Intuitively, a system is testable if it “reveals” its faults easily. If a fault is present in a system, then we want it to fail during testing as quickly as possible. Of course, calculating this probability is not easy and—as you will see when we discuss response measures for testability—other measures will be used. In addition, an architecture can enhance testability by making it easier both to replicate a bug and to narrow down the possible root causes of the bug. We do not typically think of these activities as part of testability per se, but in the end just revealing a bug isn’t enough: You also need to find and fix the bug!
