Table 13.2 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Usability Tactics Group Tactics Question Supported? (Y/N) Risk Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Support User Initiative Is the system able to listen to and respond to a cancel command? Is it possible to undo the last command, or the last several commands? Is it possible to pause and then resume long-running operations? Is it possible to aggregate UI objects into a group and apply operations on the group? Support System Initiative Does the system maintain a model of the task? Does the system maintain a model of the user? Does the system maintain a model of itself? ### 13.4 Patterns for Usability We will briefly discuss three usability patterns: model-view-controller (MVC) and its variants, observer, and memento. These patterns primarily promote usability by promoting separation of concerns, which in turn makes it easy to iterate the design of a user interface. Other kinds of patterns are also possible—including patterns used in the design of the user interface itself, such as breadcrumbs, shopping cart, or progressive disclosure—but we will not discuss them here.
