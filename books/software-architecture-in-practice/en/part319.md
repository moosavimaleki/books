# Scheduling Policies A scheduling policy conceptually has two parts: a priority assignment and dispatching. All scheduling policies assign priorities. In some cases, the assignment is as simple as first-in/first-out (or FIFO). In other cases, it can be tied to the deadline of the request or its semantic importance. Competing criteria for scheduling include optimal resource usage, request importance, minimizing the number of resources used, minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, preventing starvation to ensure fairness, and so forth. You need to be aware of these possibly conflicting criteria and the effect that the chosen scheduling policy has on the system’s ability to meet them. A high-priority event stream can be dispatched—assigned to a resource—only if that resource is available. Sometimes this depends on preempting the current user of the resource. Possible preemption options are as follows: can occur anytime, can occur only at specific preemption points, or executing processes cannot be preempted. Some common scheduling policies are these:
