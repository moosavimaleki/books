*  There is no coupling among the clients. *  The number of clients can easily scale and is constrained only by the capacity of the server. The server functionality can also scale if its capacity is exceeded. *  Clients and servers can evolve independently. *  Common services can be shared among multiple clients. *  The interaction with a user is isolated to the client. This factor has resulted in the development of specialized languages and tools for managing the user interface. Tradeoffs: *  This pattern is implemented such that communication occurs over a network, perhaps even the Internet. Thus messages may be delayed by network congestion, leading to degradation (or at least unpredictability) of performance. *  For clients that communicate with servers over a network shared by other applications, special provisions must be made for achieving security (especially confidentiality) and maintaining integrity. #### Plug-in (Microkernel) Pattern The plug-in pattern has two types of elementsâ€”elements that provide a core set of functionality and specialized variants (called plug-ins) that add functionality to the core via a fixed set of interfaces. The two types are typically bound together at build time or later.
