In contrast to trace notations, comprehensive notations show the complete behavior of structural elements. Given this type of documentation, it is possible to infer all possible paths from the initial state to the final state. State machines are a kind of formalism used by many comprehensive notations. This formalism represents the behavior of architecture elements because each state is an abstraction of all possible histories that could lead to that state. State machine languages allow you to complement a structural description of the elements of the system with constraints on interactions and timed reactions to both internal and environmental stimuli. UML state machine diagrams allow you to trace the behavior of your system, given specific inputs. Such a diagram represents states using boxes and transitions between states using arrows. Thus it models elements of the architecture and helps illustrate their runtime interactions. [Figure 22.4](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig04) is an example of a state machine diagram showing the states of a car stereo.
