Reduce Coupling Do you abstract common services, in cases where you are providing several similar services? For example, this technique is often used when you want your system to be portable across operating systems, hardware, or other environmental variations. Defer Binding Does the system regularly defer binding of important functionality so that it can be replaced later in the life cycle? For example, are there plug-ins, add-ons, resource files, or configuration files that can extend the functionality of the system? ### 8.4 Patterns Patterns for modifiability divide the system into modules in such a way that the modules can be developed and evolved separately with little interaction among them, thereby supporting portability, modifiability, and reuse. There are probably more patterns designed to support modifiability than for any other quality attribute. We present a few that are among the most commonly used here. #### Client-Server Pattern The client-server pattern consists of a server providing services simultaneously to multiple distributed clients. The most common example is a web server providing information to multiple simultaneous users of a website.
