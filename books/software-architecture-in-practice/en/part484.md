*  Elements deployed in an unreliable distributed environment will need to rely on asynchronous interactions based on consuming and producing events, exchanged via message queues or data streams. Many different interaction styles exist, but we will focus on two of the most widely used: RPC and REST. *  Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC is modeled on procedure calls in imperative languages, except that the called procedure is located elsewhere on a network. The programmer codes the procedure call as if a local procedure were being called (with some syntactic variation); the call is then translated into a message sent to a remote element where the actual procedure is invoked. Finally, the results are sent back as a message to the calling element. RPC dates from the 1980s and has undergone many modifications since its inception. The early versions of this protocol were synchronous, with the parameters of the message being sent as text. The most recent RPC version, called gRPC, transfers parameters in binary, is asynchronous, and supports authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. gRPC uses HTTP 2.0 for transport.
