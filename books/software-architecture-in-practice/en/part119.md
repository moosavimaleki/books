A tactic is a design decision that influences the achievement of a quality attribute response—it directly affects the system’s response to some stimulus. Tactics may impart portability to one design, high performance to another, and integrability to a third. An architectural pattern describes a particular recurring design problem that arises in specific design contexts and presents a well-proven architectural solution for the problem. The solution is specified by describing the roles of its constituent elements, their responsibilities and relationships, and the ways in which they collaborate. Like the choice of tactics, the choice of an architectural pattern has a profound effect on quality attributes—usually more than one. Patterns typically comprise multiple design decisions and, in fact, often comprise multiple quality attribute tactics. We say that patterns often bundle tactics and, consequently, frequently make tradeoffs among quality attributes. We will look at example relationships between tactics and patterns in each of our quality attribute–specific chapters. [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#ch14) explains how a set of tactics for any quality attribute can be constructed; those tactics are, in fact, the steps we used to produce the sets found in this book.
