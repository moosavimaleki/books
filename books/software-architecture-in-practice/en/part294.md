## 9 Performance An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises. —Mae West It’s about time. Performance, that is: It’s about time and the software system’s ability to meet timing requirements. The melancholy fact is that operations on computers take time. Computations take time on the order of thousands of nanoseconds, disk access (whether solid state or rotating) takes time on the order of tens of milliseconds, and network access takes time ranging from hundreds of microseconds within the same data center to upward of 100 milliseconds for intercontinental messages. Time must be taken into consideration when designing your system for performance. When events occur—interrupts, messages, requests from users or other systems, or clock events marking the passage of time—the system, or some element of the system, must respond to them in time. Characterizing the events that can occur (and when they can occur) and the system’s or element’s time-based response to those events is the essence of discussing performance.
