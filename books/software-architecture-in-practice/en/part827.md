The coordination between teams and modules is represented in a diagram. A human icon of team A is standing on the module A block. A human icon of team B is standing on the module B block on the right. A double-headed arrow between teams A and B represents the coordination. The right arrow from modules A to B represents the dependency. More broadly, methods for coordination include the following options: *  Informal contacts. Informal contacts, such as meeting at the coffee room or in the hallway, are possible only if the teams are co-located. *  Documentation. Documentation, if it is well written, well organized, and properly disseminated, can be used as a means to coordinate the teams, whether they are co-located or at a distance. *  Meetings. Teams can hold meetings, either scheduled or ad hoc, and either face to face or remote, to help bring the team together and raise awareness of issues.
