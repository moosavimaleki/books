From this formula, it is possible to calculate probabilities and make claims like “the system exhibits 99.999 percent availability” or “there is a 0.001 percent probability that the system will not be operational when needed.” Scheduled downtimes (when the system is intentionally taken out of service) should not be considered when calculating availability, since the system is deemed “not needed” then; of course, this is dependent on the specific requirements for the system, which are often encoded in a service level agreement (SLA). This may lead to seemingly odd situations where the system is down and users are waiting for it, but the downtime is scheduled and so is not counted against any availability requirements. Detected faults can be categorized prior to being reported and repaired. This categorization is commonly based on the fault’s severity (critical, major, or minor) and service impact (service-affecting or non-service-affecting). It provides the system operator with a timely and accurate system status and allows for an appropriate repair strategy to be employed. The repair strategy may be automated or may require manual intervention.
