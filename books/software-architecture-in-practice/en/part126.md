In [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[13](ch13.xhtml#ch13), we include a tactics-based questionnaire for each quality attribute covered in the chapters. For each question in the questionnaire, the analyst records the following information: *  Whether each tactic is supported by the system’s architecture. *  Whether there are any obvious risks in the use (or nonuse) of this tactic. If the tactic has been used, record how it is realized in the system, or how it is intended to be realized (e.g., via custom code, generic frameworks, or externally produced components). *  The specific design decisions made to realize the tactic and where in the code base the implementation (realization) may be found. This is useful for auditing and architecture reconstruction purposes. *  Any rationale or assumptions made in the realization of this tactic. To use these questionnaires, simply follow these four steps: 1.  For each tactics question, fill the “Supported” column with “Y” if the tactic is supported in the architecture and with “N” otherwise.
