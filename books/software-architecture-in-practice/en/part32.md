Some aspects of behavior are below the architect’s level of concern. Nevertheless, to the extent that an element’s behavior influences the acceptability of the system as a whole, this behavior must be considered part of the system’s architectural design, and should be documented as such. # System and Enterprise Architectures Two disciplines related to software architecture are system architecture and enterprise architecture. Both of these disciplines have broader concerns than software and affect software architecture through the establishment of constraints within which a software system, and its architect, must live. System Architecture A system’s architecture is a representation of a system in which there is a mapping of functionality onto hardware and software components, a mapping of the software architecture onto the hardware architecture, and a concern for the human interaction with these components. That is, system architecture is concerned with the totality of hardware, software, and humans. A system architecture will influence, for example, the functionality that is assigned to different processors and the types of networks that connect those processors. The software architecture will determine how this functionality is structured and how the software programs residing on the various processors interact.
