*  The 10-18 Monkey (localization-internationalization) detected configuration and runtime problems in instances serving customers in multiple geographic regions, using different languages and character sets. The name 10-18 comes from L10n-i18n, a sort of shorthand for the words “localization” and “internationalization.” Some members of the Simian Army used fault injection to place faults into the running system in a controlled and monitored fashion. Other members monitored various specialized aspects of the system and its environment. Both of these techniques have broader applicability than just for Netflix. Given that not all faults are equal in terms of severity, more emphasis should be placed on finding the most severe faults than on finding other faults. The Simian Army reflected a determination by Netflix that the targeted faults were the most serious in terms of their impacts. Netflix’s strategy illustrates that some systems are too complex and adaptive to be tested fully, because some of their behaviors are emergent. One aspect of testing in that arena is logging of operational data produced by the system, so that when failures occur, the logged data can be analyzed in the lab to try to reproduce the faults.
