Does the system statically classify devices and computational resources? That is, does the system have reference values to estimate the energy consumption of a device or resource (in cases where real-time metering is infeasible or too computationally expensive)? Resource Monitoring Does the system dynamically classify devices and computational resources? In cases where static classification is not accurate due to varying load or environmental conditions, does the system use dynamic models, based on prior data collected, to estimate the varying energy consumption of a device or resource at runtime? Resource Allocation Does the system reduce usage to scale down resource usage? That is, can the system deactivate resources when demands no longer require them, in an effort to save energy? This may involve spinning down hard drives, darkening displays, turning off CPUs or servers, running CPUs at a slower clock rate, or shutting down memory blocks of the processor that are not being used.
