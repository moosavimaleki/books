This distinction breaks down, however, when you consider the nature of some of the ”function.” If the function of the software is to control engine behavior, how can the function be correctly implemented without considering timing behavior? Is the ability to control access by requiring a user name/password combination not a function, even though it is not the purpose of any system? I much prefer using the word “responsibility” to describe computations that a system must perform. Questions such as “What are the timing constraints on that set of responsibilities?”, “What modifications are anticipated with respect to that set of responsibilities?”, and “What class of users is allowed to execute that set of responsibilities?” make sense and are actionable. The achievement of qualities induces responsibility; think of the user name/password example just mentioned. Further, one can identify responsibilities as being associated with a particular set of requirements. So does this mean that the term “functional requirement” shouldn’t be used? People have an understanding of the term, but when precision is desired, we should talk about sets of specific responsibilities instead.
