3.  You can create an image from scratch. Here, you start by obtaining installation media for your chosen operating system. You boot your new machine from the install media, and it formats the machineâ€™s disk drive, copies the operating system onto the drive, and adds the boot loader in the predetermined location. For the first two approaches, repositories of machine images (usually containing open-source software) are available that provide a variety of minimal images with just OS kernels, other images that include complete applications, and everything in between. These efficient starting points can support you in quickly trying out a new package or program. However, some issues may arise when you are pulling down and running an image that you (or your organization) did not create: *  You cannot control the versions of the OS and software. *  The image may have software that contains vulnerabilities or that is not configured securely; even worse, the image may include malware.
