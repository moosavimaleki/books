For an architect designing software using cloud services, there is not much difference, from a technical perspective, between private clouds and public clouds. Thus we will focus our discussion here on infrastructure-as-a-service public clouds. A typical public cloud data center has tens of thousands of physical devicesâ€”closer to 100,000 than to 50,000. The limiting factor on the size of a data center is the electric power it consumes and the amount of heat that the equipment produces: There are practical limits to bringing electrical power into the buildings, distributing it to the equipment, and removing the heat that the equipment generates. [Figure 17.1](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig01) shows a typical cloud data center. Each rack consists of more than 25 computers (each with multiple CPUs), with the exact number depending on the power and cooling available. The data center consists of rows and rows of such racks, with high-speed network switches connecting the racks. Cloud data centers are one reason why energy efficiency (a topic discussed in [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#ch06)) has become a critical quality attribute in some applications.
