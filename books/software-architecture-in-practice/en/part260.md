2. Write a concrete integrability scenario for a system that you are working on (perhaps an exploratory scenario for some component that you are considering integrating). 3. Which of the integrability tactics do you think would be the easiest to implement in practice, and why? Which would be the most difficult, and why? 4. Many of the integrability tactics are similar to the modifiability tactics. If you make your system highly modifiable, does that automatically mean that it will be easy to integrate into another context? 5. A standard use of SOA is to add a shopping cart feature to an e-commerce site. Which commercially available SOA platforms provide different shopping cart services? What are the attributes of the shopping carts? Can these attributes be discovered at runtime? 6. Write a program that accesses the Google Play Store, via its API, and returns a list of weather forecasting applications and their attributes.
