*  Transactions. Systems targeting high-availability services leverage transactional semantics to ensure that asynchronous messages exchanged between distributed components are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable—properties collectively referred to as the “ACID properties.” The most common realization of the transactions tactic is the “two-phase commit” (2PC) protocol. This tactic prevents race conditions caused by two processes attempting to update the same data item at the same time. *  Predictive model. A predictive model, when combined with a monitor, is employed to monitor the state of health of a system process to ensure that the system is operating within its nominal operating parameters, and to take corrective action when the system nears a critical threshold. The operational performance metrics monitored are used to predict the onset of faults; examples include the session establishment rate (in an HTTP server), threshold crossing (monitoring high and low watermarks for some constrained, shared resource), statistics on the process state (e.g., in-service, out-of-service, under maintenance, idle), and message queue length statistics.
