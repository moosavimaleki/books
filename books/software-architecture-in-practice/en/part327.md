Manage Resources Can data be cached (to maintain a local copy that can be quickly accessed) or replicated (to reduce contention)? Can queue sizes be bounded to place an upper bound on the resources needed to process stimuli? Have you ensured that the scheduling strategies you are using are appropriate for your performance concerns? ### 9.4 Patterns for Performance Performance concerns have plagued software engineers for decades, so it comes as no surprise that a rich set of patterns have been developed for managing various aspects of performance. In this section, we sample just a few of them. Note that some patterns serve multiple purposes. For example, we saw the circuit breaker pattern in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04), where it was identified as an availability pattern, but it also has a benefit for performanceâ€”since it reduces the time that you wait around for nonresponsive services. The patterns we will introduce here are service mesh, load balancer, throttling, and map-reduce.
