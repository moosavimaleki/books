Redundant spare. This tactic refers to a configuration in which one or more duplicate components can step in and take over the work if the primary component fails. This tactic is at the heart of the hot spare, warm spare, and cold spare patterns, which differ primarily in how up-to-date the backup component is at the time of its takeover. *  Rollback. A rollback permits the system to revert to a previous known good state (referred to as the “rollback line”)—rolling back time—upon the detection of a failure. Once the good state is reached, then execution can continue. This tactic is often combined with the transactions tactic and the redundant spare tactic so that after a rollback has occurred, a standby version of the failed component is promoted to active status. Rollback depends on a copy of a previous good state (a checkpoint) being available to the components that are rolling back. Checkpoints can be stored in a fixed location and updated at regular intervals, or at convenient or significant times in the processing, such as at the completion of a complex operation.
