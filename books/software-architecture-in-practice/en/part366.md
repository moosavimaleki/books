Tradeoffs: The work involved in performing the separation can be expensive, such as installing two different networks in a system to partition safety-critical and non-safety-critical messages. However, this approach limits the risk and consequences of bugs in the non-safety-critical portion from affecting the safety-critical portion. Separating the system and convincing the certification agency that the separation was performed correctly and that there are no influences from the non-safety-critical portion on the safety-critical portion is difficult, but is far easier than the alternative: having the agency certify everything to the same rigid level. *  The cost of certifying the system is reduced because you need to certify only a (usually small) portion of the total system. *  Cost and safety benefits accrue because the effort focuses on just those portions of the system that are germane to safety. *  The work involved in performing the separation can be expensive, such as installing two different networks in a system to partition safety-critical and non-safety-critical messages.
