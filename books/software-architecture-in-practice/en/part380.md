The system tracks activities within it by *  Recording access or modification *  Recording attempts to access data, resources, or services *  Notifying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an apparent attack is occurring Response measure Measures of a systemâ€™s response are related to the frequency of successful attacks, the time and cost to resist and repair attacks, and the consequential damage of those attacks. One or more of the following: *  How much of a resource is compromised or ensured *  Accuracy of attack detection *  How much time passed before an attack was detected *  How many attacks were resisted *  How long it takes to recover from a successful attack *  How much data is vulnerable to a particular attack [Figure 11.1](ch11.xhtml#ch11fig01) shows a sample concrete scenario derived from the general scenario: A disgruntled employee at a remote location attempts to improperly modify the pay rate table during normal operations. The unauthorized access is detected, the system maintains an audit trail, and the correct data is restored within one day.
