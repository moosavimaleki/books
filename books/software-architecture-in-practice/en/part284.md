Examples of usage include the following cases: *  The core functionality may be a stripped-down operating system (the microkernel) that provides the mechanisms needed to implement operating system services, such as low-level address space management, thread management, and interprocess communication (IPC). The plug-ins provide the actual operating system functionality, such as device drivers, task management, and I/O request management. *  The core functionality is a product providing services to its users. The plug-ins provide portability, such as operating system compatibility or supporting library compatibility. The plug-ins can also provide additional functionality not included in the core product. In addition, they can act as adapters to enable integration with external systems (see [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07)). Benefits: *  Plug-ins provide a controlled mechanism to extend a core product and make it useful in a variety of contexts. *  The plug-ins can be developed by different teams or organizations than the developers of the microkernel. This allows for the development of two different markets: for the core product and for the plug-ins.
