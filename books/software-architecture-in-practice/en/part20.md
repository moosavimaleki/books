But was there a need for a fourth edition? Again (and this should be abundantly obvious), we concluded an emphatic “yes”! Much has changed in the computing landscape since the last edition was published. Some quality attributes that were not previously considered have risen to importance in the daily lives of many architects. As software continues to pervade all aspects of our society, safety considerations have become paramount for many systems; think about all of the ways that software controls the cars that we now drive. Likewise, energy efficiency is a quality that few architects considered a decade ago, but now must pay attention to, from massive data centers with unquenchable needs for energy to the small (even tiny) battery-operated mobile and IoT devices that surround us. Also, given that we are, more than ever, building systems by leveraging preexisting components, the quality attribute of integrability is consuming ever-increasing amounts of our attention.
