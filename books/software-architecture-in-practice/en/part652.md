*  Does the project incorporate emerging technologies? *  Is the technology new in the company? *  Are there certain drivers, particularly QAs, whose satisfaction using the selected technology presents risks (i.e., it is not understood whether they can be satisfied)? *  Is there a lack of trusted information, internal or external, that would provide some degree of certainty that the selected technology will be useful to satisfy the project drivers? *  Are there configuration options associated with the technology that need to be tested or understood? *  Is it unclear whether the selected technology can be easily integrated with other technologies that are used in the project? If most of your answers to these questions are “yes,” then you should strongly consider the creation of a throwaway prototype. # To Prototype or Not to Prototype? Architectural decisions must often be made with imperfect knowledge. To decide which way to go, a team could run a series of experiments (such as building prototypes) to try to reduce their uncertainty about which path to follow. The problem is that such experiments could carry a substantial cost, and the conclusions drawn from them might not be definitive.
