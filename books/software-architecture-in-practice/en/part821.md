Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. Business goals lead to quality attribute requirements, which the architecture’s primary duty is to fulfill, as we discussed in [Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#ch19). Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. While we agree in principle, many developers are inexperienced. So make sure to include a skilled, experienced, and motivated architect to help guide these individuals. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. This is nonsense for nontrivial systems. Humans invented writing because our brains can’t remember everything we need to remember. Interfaces, protocols, architectural structures, and more need to be written down, and the inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of repeated instruction and resulting errors from misunderstanding belie this principle. According to this argument, nobody should produce user manuals, but should just publish the developers’ phone numbers with an open invitation to call them anytime. This is also nonsense for any system that has a maintenance phase (that’s pretty much every system) in which the original team is nowhere to be found. With whom are you going to have that face-to-face conversation to learn important details? See [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22) for our guidance in this matter.
