Software elements and environmental elements have properties in allocation views. One goal of an allocation view is to compare the properties required by the software element with the properties provided by the environmental elements to determine whether the allocation will be successful. For example, to ensure its required response time, a component has to execute on (be allocated to) a processor that provides sufficiently fast processing power. As another example, a computing platform might not allow a task to use more than 10 kilobytes of virtual memory; an execution model of the software element in question can be used to determine the required virtual memory usage. Similarly, if you are migrating a module from one team to another, you might want to ensure that the new team has the appropriate skills and background knowledge to work with that module. Allocation views can depict either static or dynamic views. A static view illustrates a fixed allocation of resources in an environment. A dynamic view shows the conditions and the triggers for which allocation of resources changes. For example, some systems provision and utilize new resources as their loads increase. An example is a load-balancing system in which new processes or threads are created on another machine. In this view, the conditions under which the allocation view changes, the allocation of runtime software, and the dynamic allocation mechanism need to be documented.
