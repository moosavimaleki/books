At worst, endless fruitless retries would make the invoking component as useless as the invoked component that has failed. This problem is especially acute in distributed systems, where you could have many callers calling an unresponsive component and effectively going out of service themselves, causing the failure to cascade across the whole system. The circuit breaker, in conjunction with software that listens to it and begins recovery procedures, prevents that problem. Tradeoffs: Care must be taken in choosing timeout (or retry) values. If the timeout is too long, then unnecessary latency is added. But if the timeout is too short, then the circuit breaker will be tripping when it does not need to—a kind of “false positive”—which can lower the availability and performance of these services. Other availability patterns that are commonly used include the following: *  This pattern can remove from individual components the policy about how many retries to allow before declaring a failure.
