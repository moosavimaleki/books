Understanding the theoretical basis of a quantum computer involves deep understanding of physics, including quantum physics, and that is far outside our scope. For context, the same was also true of classical computers when they were invented in the 1940s. Over time, the requirement for understanding how CPUs and memory work has disappeared due to the introduction of useful abstractions, such as high-level programming languages. The same thing will happen in quantum computers. In this chapter, we introduce the essential concepts of quantum computing without reference to the underlying physics (which has been known to make heads actually explode). ### 26.1 Single Qubit The fundamental unit of calculation in a quantum computer is a unit of quantum information called a qubit (more on that shortly). The simple definition of a quantum computer is a processor that manipulates qubits. At the time of this bookâ€™s publication, the best quantum computer in existence contained several hundred qubits.
