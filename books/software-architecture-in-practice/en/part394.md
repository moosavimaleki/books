Benefits: *  Depending on the specific validator that you create and deploy, this pattern can cover most of the waterfront of the “detect attack” category of tactics, all in one package. Tradeoffs: *  As always, introducing an intermediary exacts a performance price. *  Intrusion patterns change and evolve over time, so this component must be kept up-to-date so that it maintains its effectiveness. This imposes a maintenance obligation on the organization responsible for the system. #### Intrusion Prevention System An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a standalone element whose main purpose is to identify and analyze any suspicious activity.
