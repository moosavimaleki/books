Does the system use a heartbeat—a periodic message exchange between a system monitor and a process—to detect failure of a component or connection, or network congestion? Does the system use a timestamp to detect incorrect sequences of events in distributed systems? Does the system use voting to check that replicated components are producing the same results? The replicated components may be identical replicas, functionally redundant, or analytically redundant. Does the system use exception detection to detect a system condition that alters the normal flow of execution (e.g., system exception, parameter fence, parameter typing, timeout)? Can the system do a self-test to test itself for correct operation? Recover from Faults (Preparation and Repair) Does the system employ redundant spares? Is a component’s role as active versus spare fixed, or does it change in the presence of a fault? What is the switchover mechanism? What is the trigger for a switchover? How long does it take for a spare to assume its duties?
