The interface documentation indicates what other developers need to know about an interface to use it in combination with other elements. A developer might subsequently observe properties that are a manifestation of how the element is implemented, but that are not detailed in the interface documentation. Because these are not part of the interface documentation, they are subject to change, and developers use them at their own risk. Also recognize that different people need to know different kinds of information about the interface. You may have to include separate sections in the interface documentation that accommodate different stakeholders of the interface. As you document an elementâ€™s interface, keep the following stakeholder roles in mind: *  Developer of the element. Needs to be aware of the contract that their interface must fulfill. Developers can test only the information embodied in the interface description. *  Maintainer. A special kind of developer who makes assigned changes to the element and its interface while minimizing disruption of existing actors.
