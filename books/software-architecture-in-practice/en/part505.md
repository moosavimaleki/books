## 16 Virtualization Virtual means never knowing where your next byte is coming from. —Unknown In the 1960s, the computing community was frustrated by the problem of sharing resources such as memory, disk, I/O channels, and user input devices on one physical machine among several independent applications. The inability to share resources meant that only one application could be run at a time. Computers at that time cost millions of dollars—real money in those days—and most applications used only a fraction, typically around 10%, of the available resources, so this situation had a significant effect on computing costs. Virtual machines and, later, containers emerged to deal with sharing. The goal of these virtual machines and containers is to isolate one application from another, while still sharing resources. Isolation allows developers to write applications as if they are the only ones using the computer, while sharing resources allows multiple applications to run on the computer at the same time. Because the applications are sharing one physical computer with a fixed set of resources, there are limits to the illusion that isolation creates. If, for example, one application consumes all of the CPU resources, then the other applications cannot execute. For most purposes, however, these mechanisms have changed the face of systems and software architecture. They fundamentally change how we conceive of, deploy, and pay for computing resources.
