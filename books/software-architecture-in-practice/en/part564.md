*  The VM image to be launched when a new instance is created, and any instance configuration parameters required by the cloud provider, such as security settings *  The CPU utilization threshold (measured over time) for any instance above which a new instance is launched *  The CPU utilization threshold (measured over time) for any instance below which an existing instance is shut down *  The network I/O bandwidth thresholds (measured over time) for creating and deleting instances *  The minimum and maximum number of instances you want in this group The autoscaler does not create or remove instances based on instantaneous values of the CPU utilization or network I/O bandwidth metrics, for two reasons. First, these metrics have spikes and valleys and are meaningful only when averaged over a reasonable time interval. Second, allocating and starting a new VM takes a relatively long time, on the order of minutes. The VM image must be loaded and connected to the network, and the operating system must boot before it will be ready to process messages. Consequently, autoscaler rules typically are of the form, “Create a new VM when CPU utilization is above 80 percent for 5 minutes.”
