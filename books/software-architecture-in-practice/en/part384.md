*  Detect message delivery anomalies. This tactic seeks to detect potential man-in-the-middle attacks, in which a malicious party is intercepting (and possibly modifying) messages. If message delivery times are normally stable, then by checking the time that it takes to deliver or receive a message, it becomes possible to detect suspicious timing behavior. Similarly, abnormal numbers of connections and disconnections may indicate such an attack. #### Resist Attacks There are a number of well-known means of resisting an attack: *  Identify actors. Identifying actors (users or remote computers) focuses on identifying the source of any external input to the system. Users are typically identified through user IDs. Other systems may be “identified” through access codes, IP addresses, protocols, ports, or some other means. *  Authenticate actors. Authentication means ensuring that an actor is actually who or what it purports to be. Passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, two-factor authentication, and biometric identification provide a means for authentication. Another example is CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), a type of challenge–response test that is used to determine whether the user is human. Systems may require periodic reauthentication, such as when your smartphone automatically locks after a period of inactivity.
