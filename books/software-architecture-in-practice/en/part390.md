### 11.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Security Based on the tactics described in [Section 11.2](ch11.xhtml#ch11lev1sec2), we can create a set of security tacticsâ€“inspired questions, as presented in [Table 11.2](ch11.xhtml#ch11tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support security, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth. Table 11.2 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Security Tactics Group Tactics Question Supported? (Y/N) Risk Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Detecting Attacks Does the system support the detection of intrusions by, for example, comparing network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database? Does the system support the detection of denial-of-service attacks by, for example, comparing the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historical profiles of known DoS attacks?
