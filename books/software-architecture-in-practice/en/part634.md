We begin by providing an overview of ADD and its steps. This overview is followed by more detailed discussions of some of the key steps. ### 20.1 Attribute-Driven Design Architectural design for software systems is no different than design in general: It involves making decisions, and working with the available materials and skills, to satisfy requirements and constraints. In architectural design, we turn decisions about architectural drivers into structures, as shown in [Figure 20.1](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig01). Architectural drivers comprise architecturally significant requirements (ASRsâ€”the topic of [Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#ch19)), but also include functionality, constraints, architectural concerns, and design purpose. The resulting structures are then used to guide the project in the many ways we laid out in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02): They guide analysis and construction. They serve as the foundation for educating a new project member. They guide cost and schedule estimations, team formation, risk analysis and mitigation, and, of course, implementation. ![An illustration of the architecture design activity.](graphics/20fig01.jpg)
