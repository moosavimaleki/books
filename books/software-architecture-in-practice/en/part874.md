To date, except for cybersecurity, this list of potential quantum computing applications remains mostly speculation. Several cybersecurity algorithms have been proven to provide substantial improvements over classical algorithms, but the remainder of the application areas are, thus far, the subject of much and feverish research. As yet, however, none of these efforts has generated public results. As the chapter-opening quotation suggested, quantum computers are at the stage that airplanes were at the time of the Wright brothers. The promise is great but a tremendous amount of work must be done to turn the promise into reality. ### 26.6 Final Thoughts Quantum computers are currently in their infancy. Applications for such computers are primarily speculation at this point, especially applications that require large amounts of data. Nonetheless, progress is happening rapidly in terms of the number of qubits in actual physical existence. It seems reasonable that Mooreâ€™s law will apply to quantum computers, much as it has in conventional computing. If so, then the number of qubits available will grow exponentially over time.
