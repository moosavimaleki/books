*  Minimizing the impact of user errors. What can the system do to ensure that a user error has minimal impact? For example, the user may wish to cancel a command issued incorrectly or undo its effects. *  Adapting the system to user needs. How can the user (or the system itself) adapt to make the user’s task easier? For example, the system may automatically fill in URLs based on a user’s past entries. *  Increasing confidence and satisfaction. What does the system do to give the user confidence that the correct action is being taken? For example, providing feedback that indicates that the system is performing a long-running task, along with the completion percentage so far, will increase the user’s confidence in the system. Researchers focusing on human–computer interactions have used the terms user initiative, system initiative, and mixed initiative to describe which of the human–computer pair takes the initiative in performing certain actions and how the interaction proceeds. Usability scenarios can combine initiatives from both perspectives. For example, when canceling a command, the user issues a cancel (user initiative) and the system responds. During the cancel, however, the system may display a progress indicator (system initiative). Thus the cancel operation may comprise a mixed initiative. In this chapter, we will use this distinction between user initiative and system initiative to discuss the tactics that the architect uses to achieve the various scenarios.
