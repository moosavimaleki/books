Okay, enough scary stories. Let’s talk about the principles behind them as they affect software and architectures. Safety is concerned with a system’s ability to avoid straying into states that cause or lead to damage, injury, or loss of life to actors in its environment. These unsafe states can be caused by a variety of factors: *  Omissions (the failure of an event to occur). *  Commission (the spurious occurrence of an undesirable event). The event could be acceptable in some system states but undesirable in others. *  Timing. Early (the occurrence of an event before the time required) or late (the occurrence of an event after the time required) timing can both be potentially problematic. *  Problems with system values. These come in two categories: Coarse incorrect values are incorrect but detectable, whereas subtle incorrect values are typically undetectable. *  Sequence omission and commission. In a sequence of events, either an event is missing (omission) or an unexpected event is inserted (commission).
