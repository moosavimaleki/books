What are these early design decisions embodied by software architecture? Consider: *  Will the system run on one processor or be distributed across multiple processors? *  Will the software be layered? If so, how many layers will there be? What will each one do? *  Will components communicate synchronously or asynchronously? Will they interact by transferring control or data, or both? *  Will the information that flows through the system be encrypted? *  Which operating system will we use? *  Which communication protocol will we choose? Imagine the nightmare of having to change any of these or a myriad of other related decisions. Decisions like these begin to flesh out some of the structures of the architecture and their interactions. ### 2.6 Constraints on Implementation If you want your implementation to conform to an architecture, then it must conform to the design decisions prescribed by the architecture. It must have the set of elements prescribed by the architecture, these elements must interact with each other in the fashion prescribed by the architecture, and each element must fulfill its responsibility to the other elements as prescribed by the architecture. Each of these prescriptions is a constraint on the implementer.
