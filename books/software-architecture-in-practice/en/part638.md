A chart depicts the steps and artifacts of ADD. The drivers such as design purpose, primary functional requirements, quality attribute scenarios, constraints, and concerns are shown horizontally at the top. The following process steps are shown vertically below the drivers. Step 1 - review inputs; step 2 - establish iteration goal by selecting drivers; step 3 - choose one or more elements of the system to refine; step 4 - choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected drivers; step 5 - instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities, and define interfaces; step 6 - sketch views and record design decisions; step 7 - perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and achievement of design purpose. The architecture design of refined software architecture design is shown at the bottom of the process steps. Each of the process steps preceded the following step. Step 7 passes iterate to step 2 if necessary. The refined software architecture design from the previous round of iterations or the existing system (brownfield development) is passed to step 1 of the process. The artifacts flow from drivers to process steps.
