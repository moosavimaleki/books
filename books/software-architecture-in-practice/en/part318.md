*  Bound queue sizes. This tactic controls the maximum number of queued arrivals and consequently the resources used to process the arrivals. If you adopt this tactic, you need to establish a policy for what happens when the queues overflow and decide if not responding to lost events is acceptable. This tactic is frequently paired with the limit event response tactic. *  Schedule resources. Whenever contention for a resource occurs, the resource must be scheduled. Processors are scheduled, buffers are scheduled, and networks are scheduled. Your concern as an architect is to understand the characteristics of each resource’s use and choose the scheduling strategy that is compatible with it. (See the “[Scheduling Policies](ch09.xhtml#side01)” sidebar.) [Figure 9.3](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig03) summarizes the tactics for performance. ![A flowchart of the performance tactics.](graphics/09fig03.jpg) Figure 9.3 Performance tactics The performance tactics is depicted as a chart. The performance tactics is divided into control resource demand and manage resources. The control resource demand lists the following: manage work requests, limit event response, prioritize events, reduce computational overhead, bound execution times, and increase efficiency. The manage resources list the following: increase resources, introduce concurrency, maintain multiple copies of computations, maintain multiple copies of data, bound queue sizes, and schedule resources.
