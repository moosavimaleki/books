Operations are invoked to transfer control and data to the element for processing. Most operations also return a result. Operations may fail, and as part of the interface it should be clear how actors can detect errors, either signaled as part of the output or through some dedicated exception-handling channel. In addition, events—which are normally asynchronous—may be described in interfaces. Incoming events can represent the receipt of a message taken from a queue, or the arrival of a stream element that is to be consumed. Active elements—those that do not passively wait to be invoked by other elements—produce outgoing events used to notify listeners (or subscribers) about interesting things happening within the element. In addition to the data transferred via operations and events, an important aspect of interfaces is metadata, such as access rights, units of measure, or formatting assumptions. Another name for this interface metadata is properties. Property values can influence the behavior of operations, as highlighted in the quotation that began this chapter. Property values also affect the behavior of the element, depending on its state.
