*  Resource distance. The cooperating elements must agree on assumptions about shared resources. Examples of resource distance may involve devices (e.g., one element requires exclusive access to a device, whereas another expects shared access) or computational resources (e.g., one element needs 12 GB of memory to run optimally and the other needs 10 GB, but the target CPU has only 16 GB of physical memory; or three elements are simultaneously producing data at 3 Mbps each, but the communication channel offers a peak capacity of just 5 Mbps). Again, this distance may be seen as related to behavioral distance, but it should be consciously analyzed. Such details are not typically mentioned in a programming language interface description. In the organizational context, however, these unstated, implicit interfaces often add time and complexity to integration tasks (and modification and debugging tasks). This is why interfaces are architectural concerns, as we will discuss further in [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15).
