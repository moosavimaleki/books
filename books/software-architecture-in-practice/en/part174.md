### 4.6 Discussion Questions 1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for availability using each of the possible responses in the general scenario. 2. Write a concrete availability scenario for the software for a (hypothetical) driverless car. 3. Write a concrete availability scenario for a program like Microsoft Word. 4. Redundancy is a key strategy for achieving high availability. Look at the patterns and tactics presented in this chapter and decide how many of them exploit some form of redundancy and how many do not. 5. How does availability trade off against modifiability and deployability? How would you make a change to a system that is required to have 24/7 availability (i.e., no scheduled or unscheduled down time, ever)? 6. Consider the fault detection tactics (ping/echo, heartbeat, system monitor, voting, and exception detection). What are the performance implications of using these tactics? 7. Which tactics are used by a load balancer (see [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17)) when it detects a failure of an instance?
