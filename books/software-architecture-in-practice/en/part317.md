*  Maintain multiple copies of data. Two common examples of maintaining multiple copies of data are data replication and caching. Data replication involves keeping separate copies of the data to reduce the contention from multiple simultaneous accesses. Because the data being replicated is usually a copy of existing data, keeping the copies consistent and synchronized becomes a responsibility that the system must assume. Caching also involves keeping copies of data (with one set of data possibly being a subset of the other), but on storage with different access speeds. The different access speeds may be due to memory speed versus secondary storage speed, or the speed of local versus remote communication. Another responsibility with caching is choosing the data to be cached. Some caches operate by merely keeping copies of whatever was recently requested, but it is also possible to predict usersâ€™ future requests based on patterns of behavior, and to begin the calculations or prefetches necessary to comply with those requests before the user has made them.
