[Figure 12.4](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig04) summarizes the tactics used for testability. ![A flowchart of the testability tactics.](graphics/12fig04.jpg) Figure 12.4 Testability tactics The testability tactics is depicted as a chart. The testability tactics is divided into control and observe system state and limit complexity. The control and observe system state lists the following: specialized interfaces, record/playback, localize state storage, abstract data source, sandbox, and executable assertions. The limit complexity lists the following: limit structural complexity and limit nondeterminism. ### 12.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Testability Based on the tactics described in [Section 12.2](ch12.xhtml#ch12lev1sec2), we can create a set of tactics-inspired questions, as presented in [Table 12.2](ch12.xhtml#ch12tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support testability, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
