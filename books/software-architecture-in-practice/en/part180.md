*  Once in the production environment, the service is monitored closely until all parties have some level of confidence in its quality. At that point, it is considered a normal part of the system and receives the same amount of attention as the other parts of the system. You perform a different set of tests in each environment, expanding the testing scope from unit testing of a single module in the development environment, to functional testing of all the components that make up your service in the integration environment, and ending with broad quality testing in the staging environment and usage monitoring in the production environment. But not everything always goes according to plan. If you find problems after the software is in its production environment, it is often necessary to roll back to a previous version while the defect is being addressed. Architectural choices affect deployability. For example, by employing the microservice architecture pattern (see [Section 5.6](ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec6)), each team responsible for a microservice can make its own technology choices; this removes incompatibility problems that would previously have been discovered at integration time (e.g., incompatible choices of which version of a library to use). Since microservices are independent services, such choices do not cause problems.
