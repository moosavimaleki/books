To speed up releases, we need to introduce the concept of a deployment pipeline: the sequence of tools and activities that begin when you check your code into a version control system and end when your application has been deployed for users to send it requests. In between those points, a series of tools integrate and automatically test the newly committed code, test the integrated code for functionality, and test the application for concerns such as performance under load, security, and license compliance. Each stage in the deployment pipeline takes place in an environment established to support isolation of the stage and perform the actions appropriate to that stage. The major environments are as follows: *  Code is developed in a development environment for a single module where it is subject to standalone unit tests. Once it passes the tests, and after appropriate review, the code is committed to a version control system that triggers the build activities in the integration environment.
