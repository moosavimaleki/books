Limit the depth of the inheritance tree, and the number of children of a class. Limit polymorphism and dynamic calls. One structural metric that has been shown empirically to correlate to testability is the response of a class. The response of class C is a count of the number of methods of C plus the number of methods of other classes that are invoked by the methods of C. Keeping this metric low can increase testability. In addition, architecture-level coupling metrics, such as propagation cost and decoupling level, can be used to measure and track the overall level of coupling in a system’s architecture. Ensuring that the system has high cohesion, loose coupling, and separation of concerns—all modifiability tactics (see [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08))—can also help with testability. These characteristics limit the complexity of the architectural elements by giving each element a focused task such that it has limited interactions with other elements. Separation of concerns can help achieve controllability and observability, as well as reduce the size of the overall program’s state space.
