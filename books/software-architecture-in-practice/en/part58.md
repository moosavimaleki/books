#### Fewer Is Better Not all systems warrant consideration of many architectural structures. The larger the system, the more dramatic the difference between these structures tends to be; but for small systems, we can often get by with fewer structures. For example, instead of working with each of several C&C structures, usually a single one will do. If there is only one process, then the process structure collapses to a single node and need not be explicitly represented in the design. If no distribution will occur (that is, if the system is implemented on a single processor), then the deployment structure is trivial and need not be considered further. In general, you should design and document a structure only if doing so brings a positive return on the investment, usually in terms of decreased development or maintenance costs. #### Which Structures to Choose? We have briefly described a number of useful architectural structures, and many more are certainly possible. Which ones should an architect choose to work on? Which ones should the architect choose to document? Surely not all of them. A good answer is that you should think about how the various structures available to you provide insight and leverage into the systemâ€™s most important quality attributes, and then choose the ones that will play the best role in delivering those attributes.
