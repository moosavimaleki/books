*  What are the major executing components and how do they interact at runtime? *  What are the major shared data stores? *  Which parts of the system are replicated? *  How does data progress through the system? *  Which parts of the system can run in parallel? *  Can the system’s structure change as it executes and, if so, how? By extension, these structures are crucially important for asking questions about the system’s runtime properties, such as performance, security, availability, and more. C&C structures are the most common ones that we see, but two other categories of structures are important and should not be overlooked. [Figure 1.2](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig02) shows a sketch of a C&C structure of a system using an informal notation that is explained in the figure’s key. The system contains a shared repository that is accessed by servers and an administrative component. A set of client tellers can interact with the account servers and communicate among themselves using a publish-subscribe connector.
