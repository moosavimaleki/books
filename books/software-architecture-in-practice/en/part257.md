#### Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern The service-oriented architecture (SOA) pattern describes a collection of distributed components that provide and/or consume services. In an SOA, service provider components and service consumer components can use different implementation languages and platforms. Services are largely standalone entities: Service providers and service consumers are usually deployed independently, and often belong to different systems or even different organizations. Components have interfaces that describe the services they request from other components and the services they provide. A serviceâ€™s quality attributes can be specified and guaranteed with a service level agreement (SLA), which may sometimes be legally binding. Components perform their computations by requesting services from one another. Communication among the services is typically performed by using web services standards such as WSDL (Web Services Description Language) or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The SOA pattern is related to the microservice architecture pattern (see [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05)). Micro-service architectures are assumed to compose a single system and be managed by a single organization, however, whereas SOAs provide reusable components that are assumed to be heterogeneous and managed by distinct organizations.
