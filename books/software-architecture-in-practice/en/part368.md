*  A: Catastrophic. Failure may cause deaths, usually with loss of the airplane. *  B: Hazardous. Failure has a large negative impact on safety or performance, or reduces the crew’s ability to operate the aircraft due to physical distress or a higher workload, or causes serious or fatal injuries among the passengers. *  C: Major. Failure significantly reduces the safety margin or significantly increases crew workload, and may result in passenger discomfort (or even minor injuries). *  D: Minor. Failure slightly reduces the safety margin or slightly increases crew workload. Examples might include causing passenger inconvenience or a routine flight plan change. *  E: No effect. Failure has no impact on safety, aircraft operation, or crew workload. Software validation and testing is a terrifically expensive task, undertaken with very finite budgets. DALs help you decide where to put your limited testing resources. The next time you’re on a commercial airline flight, if you see a glitch in the entertainment system or your reading light keeps blinking off, take comfort by thinking of all the validation money spent on making sure the flight control system works just fine.
