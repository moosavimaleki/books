In ADD, architecture design is performed in rounds, each of which may consist of a series of design iterations. A round comprises the architecture design activities performed within a development cycle. Through one or more iterations, you produce an architecture that suits the established design purpose for this round. Within each iteration, a series of design steps is performed. ADD provides detailed guidance on the steps that need to be performed inside each iteration. [Figure 20.3](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig03) shows the steps and artifacts associated with ADD. In the figure, steps 1–7 constitute a round. Within a round, steps 2–7 constitute one or more iterations within a round. In the following subsections, we provide an overview of each of these steps. ![An illustration of the steps and artifacts of ADD.](graphics/20fig03.jpg) Figure 20.3 Steps and artifacts of ADD
