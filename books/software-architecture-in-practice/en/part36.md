Figure 1.1 Physiological structures Architectural structures also have counterparts in human endeavors. For example, electricians, plumbers, heating and air conditioning specialists, roofers, and framers are each concerned with different structures in a building. You can readily see the qualities that are the focus of each of these structures. So it is with software. #### Three Kinds of Structures Architectural structures can be divided into three major categories, depending on the broad nature of the elements they show and the kinds of reasoning they support: 1.  Component-and-connector (C&C) structures focus on the way the elements interact with each other at runtime to carry out the systemâ€™s functions. They describe how the system is structured as a set of elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions (connectors). Components are the principal units of computation and could be services, peers, clients, servers, filters, or many other types of runtime element. Connectors are the communication vehicles among components, such as call-return, process synchronization operators, pipes, or others. C&C structures help answer questions such as the following:
