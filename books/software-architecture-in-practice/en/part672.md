The version of ADD described in this chapter is ADD 3.0. Some important improvements over the original version include giving more consideration to the selection of implementation technologies as primary design concepts, considering additional drivers such as design purpose and architectural concerns, making initial documentation and analysis be explicit steps of the design process, and providing guidance in how to begin the design process and how to use it in Agile settings. An entire book [[Cervantes 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_54)] is devoted to architecture design using ADD 3.0. Some of the concepts of ADD 3.0 were first introduced in an IEEE Software article [[Cervantes 13](ref01.xhtml#ref_53)]. George Fairbanks wrote an engaging book that describes a risk-driven process of architecture design, entitled Just Enough Software Architecture: A Risk-Driven Approach [[Fairbanks 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_85)]. The Value of Information technique dates from the 1960s [[Raiffa 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_215)]. A more modern treatment can be found in [[Hubbard 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_118)]. For a general approach on systems design, you can read the classic tome by Butler Lampson [[Lampson 11](ref01.xhtml#ref_159)].
