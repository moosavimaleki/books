The long tail latency phenomenon in the context of the cloud was first identified in [[Dean 13](ref01.xhtml#ref_76)]. Paxos was first presented by [[Lamport 98](ref01.xhtml#ref_158)]. People found the original article difficult to understand, but a very thorough description of Paxos can be found in Wikipedia—[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)). Around the same time, Brian Oki and Barbara Liskov independently developed and published an algorithm called Viewstamped Replication that was later shown to be equivalent to Lamport’s Paxos [[Oki 88](ref01.xhtml#ref_200)].

A load balancer is a type of intermediary. Intermediaries enhance modifiability but detract from performance, yet a load balancer exists to increase performance. Explain this apparent paradox.
