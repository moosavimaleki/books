*  Validate input. Cleaning and checking input as it is received by a system, or portion of a system, is an important early line of defense in resisting attacks. This is often implemented by using a security framework or validation class to perform actions such as filtering, canonicalization, and sanitization of input. Data validation is the main form of defense against attacks such as SQL injection, in which malicious code is inserted into SQL statements, and cross-site scripting (XSS), in which malicious code from a server runs on a client. *  Change credential settings. Many systems have default security settings assigned when the system is delivered. Forcing the user to change those settings will prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through settings that may be publicly available. Similarly, many systems require users to choose a new password after some maximum time period. #### React to Attacks Several tactics are intended to respond to a potential attack.
