Mobile systems utilize a variety of sensors. Sensors provide readings of the external environment, which the architect then uses to develop a representation within the system of the external environment. Sensor readings are processed by a sensor stack specific to each operating system; these stacks will deliver readings meaningful to the representation. It may take multiple sensors to develop a meaningful representation, with the readings from these sensors then being fused (integrated). Sensors may also become degraded over time, so multiple sensors may be needed to get an accurate representation of the phenomenon being measured. Resources have physical characteristics such as size and weight, have processing capabilities, and carry a cost. The design choices involve tradeoffs among these factors. Critical functions may require more powerful and reliable resources. Some functions may be shared between the mobile system and the cloud, and some functions may be shut down in certain modes to free up resources for other functions.
