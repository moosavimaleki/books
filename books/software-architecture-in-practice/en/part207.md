#### Patterns for Partial Replacement of Services Sometimes changing all instances of a service is undesirable. Partial-deployment patterns aim at providing multiple versions of a service simultaneously for different user groups; they are used for purposes such as quality control (canary testing) and marketing tests (A/B testing). ##### Canary Testing Before rolling out a new release, it is prudent to test it in the production environment, but with a limited set of users. Canary testing is the continuous deployment analog of beta testing.[5](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn5a) Canary testing designates a small set of users who will test the new release. Sometimes, these testers are so-called power users or preview-stream users from outside your organization who are more likely to exercise code paths and edge cases that typical users may use less frequently. Users may or may not know that they are being used as guinea pigsâ€”er, that is, canaries. Another approach is to use testers from within the organization that is developing the software. For example, Google employees almost never use the release that external users would be using, but instead act as testers for upcoming releases. When the focus of the testing is on determining how well new features are accepted, a variant of canary testing called dark launch is used.
