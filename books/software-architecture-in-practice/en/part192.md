Figure 5.2 Goal of deployability tactics The tactics for deployability are shown in [Figure 5.3](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig03). In many cases, these tactics will be provided, at least in part, by a CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) infrastructure that you buy rather than build. In such a case, your job as an architect is often one of choosing and assessing (rather than implementing) the right deployability tactics and the right combination of tactics. ![A flowchart of the deployability tactics.](graphics/05fig03.jpg) Figure 5.3 Deployability tactics The deployability tactics is depicted as a chart. The deployability tactics is divided into manage deployment pipeline and manage deployed system. The manage deployment pipeline list the following: scale rollouts, script deployment commands, and rollback. The manage deployed system lists the following: manage service interactions, package dependencies, and toggle features. Next, we describe these six deployability tactics in more detail. The first category of deployability tactics focuses on strategies for managing the deployment pipeline, and the second category deals with managing the system as it is being deployed and once it has been deployed.
