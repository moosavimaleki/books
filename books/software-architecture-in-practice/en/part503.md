2. Document the interface to a light bulb. Document its operations, events, and properties. Document its performance and resource utilization. Document any error states it may enter and what the result will be. Can you think of multiple implementations that have the same interface you just described? 3. Under what circumstances should performance (e.g., how long an operation takes) be a part of an element’s published interface? Under what circumstances should it not? 4. Suppose an architectural element will be used in a high-availability system. How might that affect its interface documentation? Suppose the same element will now be used in a high-security system. What might you document differently? 5. The section “[Error Handling](ch15.xhtml#ch15lev2sec8)” listed a number of different error-handling strategies. For each, when is its use appropriate? Inappropriate? What quality attributes will each enhance or diminish? 6. What would you have done to prevent the interface error that led to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter, as described at the beginning of this chapter?
