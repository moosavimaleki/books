Consider the trend toward services and microservices in computation today. This approach is fundamentally about decoupling components to reduce the number and distance of their dependencies. Services only “know” each other via their published interfaces and, if that interface is an appropriate abstraction, changes to one service have less chance to ripple to other services in the system. The ever-increasing decoupling of components is an industry-wide trend that has been going on for decades. Service orientation, by itself, addresses (that is, reduces) only the syntactic aspects of dependency; it does not address the temporal or semantic aspects. Supposedly decoupled components that have detailed knowledge of each other and make assumptions about each other are in fact tightly coupled, and changing them in the future may well be costly. For integrability purposes, “interfaces” must be understood as much more than simply APIs. They must characterize all of the relevant dependencies between the elements. When trying to understand dependencies between components, the concept of “distance” is helpful. As components interact, how aligned are they with respect to how they cooperate to successfully carry out an interaction? Distance may mean:
