*  One or more context diagrams. A context diagram shows how the system or portion of the system relates to its environment. The purpose of this diagram is to depict the scope of a view. Here “context” means an environment with which the (part of the) system interacts. Entities in the environment may be humans, other computer systems, or physical objects, such as sensors or controlled devices. A context diagram may be created for each view, with each diagram showing how different types of elements interact with the system’s environment. Context diagrams are useful for presenting an initial picture of how a system or subsystem interacts with its environment. *  Variability guide. A variability guide shows how to exercise any variation points that are part of the architecture shown in this view. *  Rationale. The rationale explains why the design reflected in the view came to be. The goal of this section is to explain why the design has its present form and to provide a convincing argument that it is sound. Documenting the rationale is described in more detail in [Section 22.7](ch22.xhtml#ch22lev1sec7).
