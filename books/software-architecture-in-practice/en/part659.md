#### Associating Responsibilities and Identifying Properties When you are creating elements by instantiating design concepts, you need to consider the responsibilities that are allocated to these elements. For example, if you instantiate the microservices architecture pattern ([Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05)), you need to decide what the microservices will do, how many of each you will deploy, and what the properties of those microservices will be. When instantiating elements and allocating responsibilities, you should keep in mind the design principle that elements should have high cohesion (internally), be defined by a narrow set of responsibilities, and demonstrate low coupling (externally). An important aspect that you need to consider when instantiating design concepts is the properties of the elements. This may involve aspects such as the configuration options, statefulness, resource management, priority, or even hardware characteristics (if the elements that you created are physical nodes) of the chosen technologies. Identifying these properties supports analysis and the documentation of your design rationale.
