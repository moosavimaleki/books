*  Separating the system and convincing the certification agency that the separation was performed correctly and that there are no influences from the non-safety-critical portion on the safety-critical portion is difficult, but is far easier than the alternative: having the agency certify everything to the same rigid level. # Design Assurance Levels The separated safety pattern emphasizes dividing the software system into safety-critical portions and non-safety-critical portions. In avionics, the distinction is finer-grained. DO-178C, “Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification,” is the primary document by which certification authorities such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and Transport Canada approve all commercial software-based aerospace systems. It defines a ranking called Design Assurance Level (DAL) for each software function. The DAL is determined from the safety assessment process and hazard analysis by examining the effects of a failure condition in the system. The failure conditions are categorized by their effects on the aircraft, crew, and passengers:
