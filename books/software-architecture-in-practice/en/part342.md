But connecting to the outside world doesn’t have to mean robot arms or uranium centrifuges or missile launchers: Connecting to a simple display screen is enough. Sometimes all the computer has to do is send erroneous information to its human operators. In September 1983, a Soviet satellite sent data to its ground system computer, which interpreted that data as a missile launched from the United States aimed at Moscow. Seconds later, the computer reported a second missile in flight. Soon, a third, then a fourth, and then a fifth appeared. Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov made the astonishing decision to ignore the computers, believing them to be in error. He thought it extremely unlikely that the United States would have fired just a few missiles, thereby inviting mass retaliatory destruction. He decided to wait it out, to see if the missiles were real—that is, to see if his country’s capital city was going to be incinerated. As we know, it wasn’t. The Soviet system had mistaken a rare sunlight condition for missiles in flight. You and/or your parents may well owe your life to Lieutenant Colonel Petrov.
