*  Detect intrusion. This tactic compares network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database. The signatures can be based on protocol characteristics, request characteristics, payload sizes, applications, source or destination address, or port number. *  Detect service denial. This tactic compares the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historical profiles of known denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. *  Verify message integrity. This tactic employs techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. A checksum is a validation mechanism wherein the system separately maintains redundant information for files and messages, and uses this redundant information to verify the file or message. A hash value is a unique string generated by a hashing function, whose input could be files or messages. Even a slight change in the original files or messages results in a significant change in the hash value.
