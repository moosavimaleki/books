Once the design performed in the iteration has been analyzed, you should review the state of your architecture in terms of your established design purpose. This means considering if, at this point, you have performed enough design iterations to satisfy the drivers that are associated with the design round. It also means considering whether the design purpose has been achieved or if additional design rounds are needed in future project increments. In Section 20.6, we discuss simple techniques that allow you to keep track of design progress. #### Iterate If Necessary You should perform additional iterations and repeat steps 2–7 for every driver that was considered. More often than not, however, this kind of repetition will not be possible because of time or resource constraints that force you to stop the design activities and move on to implementation. What are the criteria for evaluating if more design iterations are necessary? Let risk be your guide. You should at least have addressed the drivers with the highest priority. Ideally, you should have certainty that critical drivers are satisfied or, at least, that the design is “good enough” to satisfy them.
