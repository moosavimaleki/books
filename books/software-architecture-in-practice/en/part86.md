Any design, in any discipline, can be viewed as a sequence of decisions. When painting a picture, an artist decides on the material for the canvas and the media for recording—oil paint, watercolor, crayon—even before the picture is begun. Once the picture is begun, other decisions are immediately made: Where is the first line, what is its thickness, what is its shape? All of these early design decisions have a strong influence on the final appearance of the picture, and each decision constrains the many decisions that follow. Each decision, in isolation, might appear innocent enough, but the early ones in particular have disproportionate weight simply because they influence and constrain so much of what follows. So it is with architecture design. An architecture design can also be viewed as a set of decisions. Changing these early decisions will cause a ripple effect, in terms of the additional decisions that must now be changed. Yes, sometimes the architecture must be refactored or redesigned, but this is not a task we undertake lightly—because the “ripple” might turn into an avalanche.
