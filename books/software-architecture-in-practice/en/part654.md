To decide whether it is worth it to conduct the experiments, or how much we should be willing to spend on experimentation in relation to the confidence to be gained and the cost of being wrong, the team could use a technique known as Value of Information (VoI) to settle the questions. The VoI technique is used to calculate the expected gain from a reduction in the uncertainty surrounding a decision through some form of data collection exercise—in this case, the construction of prototypes. To use VoI, the team will need to assess the following parameters: the cost of making the wrong design choice, the cost of performing the experiments, the team’s level of confidence in each design choice, and their level of confidence in the results of the experiments. Using these estimates, VoI then applies Bayes’s Theorem to calculate two quantities: the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of sample or imperfect information (EVSI). EVPI denotes the maximum one should be willing to pay for the experiments, were they to provide definitive results (e.g., no false positives or false negatives). EVSI represents how much one should be willing to spend knowing that the results of the experiment might not identify the right solution with 100 percent certainty.
