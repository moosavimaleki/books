1.  The definitions provided for an attribute are not testable. It is meaningless to say that a system will be “modifiable.” Every system will be modifiable with respect to one set of changes and not modifiable with respect to another. The other quality attributes are similar in this regard: A system may be robust with respect to some faults and brittle with respect to others, and so forth. 2.  Discussion often focuses on which quality a particular issue belongs to. Is a denial-of-service attack on a system an aspect of availability, an aspect of performance, an aspect of security, or an aspect of usability? All four attribute communities would claim “ownership” of the denial-of-service attack. All are, to some extent, correct. But this debate over categorization doesn’t help us, as architects, understand and create architectural solutions to actually manage the attributes of concern. 3.  Each attribute community has developed its own vocabulary. The performance community has “events” arriving at a system, the security community has “attacks” arriving at a system, the availability community has “faults” arriving, and the usability community has “user input.” All of these may actually refer to the same occurrence, but they are described using different terms.
