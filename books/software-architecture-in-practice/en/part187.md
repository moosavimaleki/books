To achieve these goals, an architect needs to consider how an executable is updated on a host platform, and how it is subsequently invoked, measured, monitored, and controlled. Mobile systems in particular present a challenge for deployability in terms of how they are updated because of concerns about bandwidth. Some of the issues involved in deploying software are as follows: *  How does it arrive at its host (i.e., push, where updates deployed are unbidden, or pull, where users or administrators must explicitly request updates)? *  How is it integrated into an existing system? Can this be done while the existing system is executing? *  What is the medium, such as DVD, USB drive, or Internet delivery? *  What is the packaging (e.g., executable, app, plug-in)? *  What is the resulting integration into an existing system? *  What is the efficiency of executing the process? *  What is the controllability of the process?
