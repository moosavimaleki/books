*  Interoperability. Does the representation used by the interface match what its actors expect and know how to parse? A standard representation (such as JSON, described later in this section) will make it easy for actors to transform the bits transmitted across the network into internal data structures. Does the interface implement a standard? *  Performance. Does the chosen representation allow efficient usage of the available communication bandwidth? What is the algorithmic complexity of parsing the representation to read its content into the internal element representation? How much time is spent preparing the messages before they can be sent out? What is the monetary cost of the required bandwidth? *  Implicit coupling. What are the assumptions shared by the actors and elements that could lead to errors and data loss when decoding messages? *  Transparency. Is it possible to intercept the exchanged messages and easily observe their content? This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, if self-describing messages help developers more easily debug message payloads and eavesdroppers more readily intercept and interpret their content. On the other hand, binary representations, particularly encrypted ones, require special debugging tools, but are more secure.
