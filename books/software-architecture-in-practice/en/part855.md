The Information Technology Architecture Body of Knowledge (ITABoK) is a “free public archive of IT architecture best practices, skills, and knowledge developed from the experience of individual and corporate members of Iasa, the world’s largest IT architecture professional organization” ([https://itabok.iasaglobal.org/itabok/](https://itabok.iasaglobal.org/itabok/)). Bredemeyer Consulting ([bredemeyer.com](http://bredemeyer.com)) provides copious materials about IT, software, and enterprise architects and their role. Joseph Ingeno, in Software Architect’s Handbook, devotes a chapter to “The Soft Skills of Software Architects” and another one to “Becoming a Better Software Architect” [[Ingeno 18](ref01.xhtml#ref_128)]. ### 25.6 Discussion Questions 1.
