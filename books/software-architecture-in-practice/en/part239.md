In essence, integrability is about discerning and bridging the distance between the elements of each potential dependency. This is a form of planning for modifiability. We will revisit this topic in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08). ### 7.2 General Scenario for Integrability [Table 7.1](ch07.xhtml#ch07tab01) presents the general scenario for integrability. Table 7.1 General Scenario for Integrability Portion of Scenario Description Possible Values Source Where does the stimulus come from? One or more of the following: *  Mission/system stakeholder *  Component marketplace *  Component vendor Stimulus What is the stimulus? That is, what kind of integration is being described? One of the following: *  Add new component *  Integrate new version of existing component *  Integrate existing components together in a new way Artifact What parts of the system are involved in the integration? One of the following: *  Entire system *  Specific set of components *  Component metadata *  Component configuration Environment What state is the system in when the stimulus occurs?
