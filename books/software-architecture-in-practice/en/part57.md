Whereas the correspondence between the elements in the decomposition structure and the client-server structure is obvious, these two views are used for very different things. For example, the view on the right could be used for performance analysis, bottleneck prediction, and network traffic management, which would be extremely difficult or impossible to do with the view on the left. (In [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), we’ll learn about the map-reduce pattern, in which copies of simple, identical functionality are distributed across hundreds or thousands of processing nodes—one module for the whole system, but one component per node.) Individual projects sometimes consider one structure to be dominant and cast other structures, when possible, in terms of the dominant structure. Often, the dominant structure is the module decomposition structure, and for good reason: It tends to spawn the project structure, since it mirrors the team structure of development. In other projects, the dominant structure might be a C&C structure that shows how the system’s functionality and/or critical quality attributes are achieved at runtime.
