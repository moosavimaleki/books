*  Traceability is the ability to recover all of the artifacts that led to an element having a problem. That includes all the code and dependencies that are included in that element. It also includes the test cases that were run on that element and the tools that were used to produce the element. Errors in tools used in the deployment pipeline can cause problems in production. Typically, traceability information is kept in an artifact database. This database will contain code version numbers, version numbers of elements the system depends on (such as libraries), test version numbers, and tool version numbers. *  Repeatability is getting the same result when you perform the same action with the same artifacts. This is not as easy as it sounds. For example, suppose your build process fetches the latest version of a library. The next time you execute the build process, a new version of the library may have been released. As another example, suppose one test modifies some values in the database. If the original values are not restored, subsequent tests may not produce the same results.
