![An illustration of a node is shown as a large block. The node contains two pods such as pod 1 and pod 2 as a vertical rectangle. Pod 1 contains two containers 1 and 2. Pod 2 has a container 3.](graphics/16fig04.jpg) Figure 16.4 Node with Pods that in turn have containers The purpose of a Pod is to reduce communication costs between closely related containers. In [Figure 16.4](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig04), if container 1 and container 2 communicate frequently, the fact they are deployed as a Pod, and thus allocated onto the same VM, allows the use of faster communication mechanisms than message passing. ### 16.8 Serverless Architecture Recall that allocating a VM starts by locating a physical machine with enough free capacity and then loading a VM image into that physical machine. The physical computers, therefore, constitute a pool from which you can allocate resources. Suppose now that instead of allocating VMs into physical machines, you wish to allocate containers into container runtime engines. That is, you have a pool of container runtime engines, into which containers are allocated.
