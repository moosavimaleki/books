Table 8.2 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Modifiability Tactics Group Tactics Question Supported? (Y/N) Risk? Design Decisions and Location Rationale and Assumptions Increase Cohesion Do you make modules more cohesive by splitting the module? For example, if you have a large, complex module, can you split it into two (or more) more cohesive modules? Do you make modules more cohesive by redistributing responsibilities? For example, if responsibilities in a module do not serve the same purpose, they should be placed in other modules. Reduce Coupling Do you consistently encapsulate functionality? This typically involves isolating the functionality under scrutiny and introducing an explicit interface to it. Do you consistently use an intermediary to keep modules from being too tightly coupled? For example, if A calls concrete functionality C, you might introduce an abstraction B that mediates between A and C. Do you restrict dependencies between modules in a systematic way? Or is any system module free to interact with any other module?
