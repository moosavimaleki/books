### 1.4 Summary The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. There are three categories of structures: *  Module structures show the system as a set of code or data units that have to be constructed or procured. *  Component-and-connector structures show the system as a set of elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions (connectors). *  Allocation structures show how elements from module and C&C structures relate to nonsoftware structures (such as CPUs, file systems, networks, and development teams). Structures represent the primary engineering leverage points of an architecture. Each structure brings with it the power to manipulate one or more quality attributes. Collectively, structures represent a powerful approach for creating the architecture (and, later, for analyzing it and explaining it to its stakeholders). And, as we will see in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22), the structures that the architect has chosen as engineering leverage points are also the primary candidates to choose as the basis for architecture documentation.
