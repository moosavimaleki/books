Mobile devices present some unique considerations for testing: *  Test display layouts. Smartphones and tablets come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios. Verifying the correctness of the layout on all of these devices is complicated. Some operating system frameworks allow the user interface to be operated from unit tests, but may miss some unpleasant edge cases. For example, suppose you display control buttons on your screen, with the layout specified in HTML and CSS, and suppose it’s automatically generated for all display devices you anticipate using. A naive generation for a tiny display could produce a control on a 1 × 1 pixel, or controls right at the edge of the display, or controls that overlap. These may easily escape detection during testing. *  Test operational edge cases. An application should survive battery exhaustion and shutdown of the system. The preservation of state in such cases needs to be ensured and tested.
