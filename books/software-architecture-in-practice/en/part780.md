Whether they change at runtime or as a result of high-frequency release-and-deploy cycles, all dynamic architectures share something in common with respect to documentation: They change much faster than the documentation cycle. In either case, no one is going to hold up things until a new architecture document is produced, reviewed, and released. Even so, knowing the architecture of these ever-changing systems is every bit as important, and arguably more so, than for systems that follow more traditional life cycles. Here’s what you can do if you’re an architect in a highly dynamic environment: *  Document what is true about all versions of your system. Your web browser doesn’t go out and grab just any piece of software when it needs a new plug-in; a plug-in must have specific properties and a specific interface. And that new piece of software doesn’t just plug in anywhere, but rather in a predetermined location in the architecture. Record those invariants. This process may make your documented architecture more a description of constraints or guidelines that any compliant version of the system must follow. That’s fine.
