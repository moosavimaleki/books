*  Exception handling. Once an exception has been detected, the system will handle it in some fashion. The easiest thing it can do is simply to crash—but, of course, that’s a terrible idea from the point of availability, usability, testability, and plain good sense. There are much more productive possibilities. The mechanism employed for exception handling depends largely on the programming environment employed, ranging from simple function return codes (error codes) to the use of exception classes that contain information helpful in fault correlation, such as the name of the exception, the origin of the exception, and the cause of the exception Software can then use this information to mask or repair the fault. *  Software upgrade. The goal of this tactic is to achieve in-service upgrades to executable code images in a non-service-affecting manner. Strategies include the following: Function patch. This kind of patch, which is used in procedural programming, employs an incremental linker/loader to store an updated software function into a pre-allocated segment of target memory. The new version of the software function will employ the entry and exit points of the deprecated function.
