## 11 Security If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees. —Kahlil Gibran Security is a measure of the system’s ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized. An attack—that is, an action taken against a computer system with the intention of doing harm—can take a number of forms. It may be an unauthorized attempt to access data or services or to modify data, or it may be intended to deny services to legitimate users. The simplest approach to characterizing security focuses on three characteristics: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA): *  Confidentiality is the property that data or services are protected from unauthorized access. For example, a hacker cannot access your income tax returns on a government computer. *  Integrity is the property that data or services are not subject to unauthorized manipulation. For example, your grade has not been changed since your instructor assigned it.
