In all of these contexts, energy efficiency must be balanced with performance and availability, requiring engineers to consciously reason about such tradeoffs. In the cloud context, greater allocation of resources—more servers, more storage, and so on—creates improved performance capabilities as well as improved robustness against failures of individual devices, but at the cost of energy and capital outlays. In the mobile and IoT contexts, greater allocation of resources is typically not an option (although shifting the computational burden from a mobile device to a cloud back-end is possible), so the tradeoffs tend to center on energy efficiency versus performance and usability. Finally, in all contexts, there are tradeoffs between energy efficiency, on the one hand, and buildability and modifiability, on the other hand. ### 6.1 Energy Efficiency General Scenario From these considerations, we can now determine the various portions of the energy efficiency general scenario, as presented in [Table 6.1](ch06.xhtml#ch06tab01).
