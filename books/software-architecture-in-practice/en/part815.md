*  Work with the project’s stakeholders to determine the release tempo and the contents of each project increment. *  Your first architectural increment should include module decomposition and uses views, as well as a preliminary C&C view. *  Use your influence to ensure that early releases deal with the system’s most challenging quality attribute requirements, thereby ensuring that no unpleasant architectural surprises appear late in the development cycle. *  Stage your architecture releases to support those project increments and to support the needs of the development stakeholders as they work on each increment. ### 24.3 Architecture and Agile Development Agile development began as a rebellion against—among other things—development approaches that were rigid and heavyweight with respect to process, overbearing with respect to required documentation, focused on up-front planning and design, and culminating in a single delivery that everyone hoped would resemble what it was that the customer wanted in the first place. Agilistas advocate allocating resources that might otherwise be spent on process and documentation to figuring out what the customer really wants and providing it in small, testable delivery increments, starting very early on.
