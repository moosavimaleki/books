*  What is the assignment of each software element to development teams? #### Some Useful Module Structures Useful module structures include: *  Decomposition structure. The units are modules that are related to each other by the “is-a-submodule-of” relation, showing how modules are decomposed into smaller modules recursively until the modules are small enough to be easily understood. Modules in this structure represent a common starting point for design, as the architect enumerates what the units of software will have to do and assigns each item to a module for subsequent (more detailed) design and eventual implementation. Modules often have products (such as interface specifications, code, and test plans) associated with them. The decomposition structure determines, to a large degree, the system’s modifiability. That is, do changes fall within the purview of a few (preferably small) modules? This structure is often used as the basis for the development project’s organization, including the structure of the documentation, and the project’s integration and test plans. [Figure 1.5](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig05) shows an example of a decomposition structure.
