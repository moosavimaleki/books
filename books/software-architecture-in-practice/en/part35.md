### 1.2 Architectural Structures and Views Because architectural structures are at the heart of our definition and treatment of software architecture, this section will explore these concepts in more depth. These concepts are dealt with in much greater depth in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22), where we discuss architecture documentation. Architectural structures have counterparts in nature. For example, the neurologist, the orthopedist, the hematologist, and the dermatologist all have different views of the various structures of a human body, as illustrated in [Figure 1.1](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig01). Ophthalmologists, cardiologists, and podiatrists concentrate on specific subsystems. Kinesiologists and psychiatrists are concerned with different aspects of the entire arrangementâ€™s behavior. Although these views are pictured differently and have very different properties, all are inherently related and interconnected: Together they describe the architecture of the human body. ![Four figures show the physiological structures of the human body. The figures show the skeletal system of the human body, tissue system of the human body, Highlights the human brain, and highlight the human heart respectively.](graphics/01fig01.jpg)
