Containment: Barrier Does the system support limiting access to critical resources (e.g., processors, memory, and network connections) through a firewall? Does the system control access to protected components and protect against failures arising from incorrect sequencing of events through interlocks? Recovery Is the system able to roll back—that is, to revert to a previous known good state—upon the detection of a failure? Can the system repair a state determined to be erroneous, without failure, and then continue execution? Can the system reconfigure resources, in the event of failures, by remapping the logical architecture onto the resources left functioning? Prior to beginning the tactics-based questionnaire for safety, you should assess whether the project under review has performed a hazard analysis or FTA to identify what constitutes an unsafe state (to be detected, avoided, contained, or recovered from) in your system. Without this analysis, designing for safety is likely to be less effective.
