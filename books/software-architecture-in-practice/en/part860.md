Quantum computers are generating high interest because of their potential to perform calculations at speeds that far outpace the most capable and powerful of their classical counterparts. In 2019, Google announced that its quantum computer completed a complex computation in 200 seconds. That same calculation, claimed Google, would take even the most powerful supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish. It isn’t that quantum computers do what classical computers do, only extraordinarily faster; rather, they do what classical computers can’t do using the otherworldly properties of quantum physics. Quantum computers won’t be better than classical computers at solving every problem. For example, for many of the most common transaction-oriented data-processing tasks, they are likely irrelevant. They will be good at problems that involve combinatorics and are computationally difficult for classic computers. However, it is unlikely that a quantum computer will ever power your phone or watch or sit on your office desk.
