This seems simple, but in real systems it can be complicated. There is usually a cost, such as a latency penalty, for a recovery action. You may need to start a new VM, which could take minutes before it is ready to accept new requests. You may need to establish a new session with a different service instance, which may affect the usability of your system. The response times in cloud systems can show considerable variations. Jumping to a conclusion that there was a failure, when there was actually just a temporary delay, may add a recovery cost when it isn’t necessary. Distributed system designers generally parameterize the timeout detection mechanism so that it can be tuned for a system or infrastructure. One parameter is the timeout interval—how long the system should wait before deciding that a response has failed. Most systems do not trigger failure recovery after a single missed response. Instead, the typical approach is to look for some number of missed responses over a longer time interval. The number of missed responses is a second parameter for the timeout mechanism. For example, a timeout might be set to 200 milliseconds, and failure recovery is triggered after 3 missed messages over a 1-second interval.
