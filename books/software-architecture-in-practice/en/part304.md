### 9.2 Tactics for Performance The goal of performance tactics is to generate a response to events arriving at the system under some time-based or resource-based constraint. The event can be a single event or a stream, and is the trigger to perform computation. Performance tactics control the time or resources used to generate a response, as illustrated in [Figure 9.2](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig02). ![The goal of performance tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the events that arrive. The response is the events processed within time and resource budgets.](graphics/09fig02.jpg) Figure 9.2 The goal of performance tactics At any instant during the period after an event arrives but before the systemâ€™s response to it is complete, either the system is working to respond to that event or the processing is blocked for some reason. This leads to the two basic contributors to the response time and resource usage: processing time (when the system is working to respond and actively consuming resources) and blocked time (when the system is unable to respond).
