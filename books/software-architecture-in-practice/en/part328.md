#### Service Mesh The service mesh pattern is used in microservice architectures. The main feature of the mesh is a sidecar—a kind of proxy that accompanies each microservice, and which provides broadly useful capabilities to address application-independent concerns such as interservice communications, monitoring, and security. A sidecar executes alongside each microservice and handles all interservice communication and coordination. (As we will describe in [Chapter 16](ch16.xhtml#ch16), these elements are often packaged into pods.) They are deployed together, which cuts down on the latency due to networking, thereby boosting performance. This approach allows developers to separate the functionality—the core business logic—of the microservice from the implementation, management, and maintenance of cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication and authorization, service discovery, load balancing, encryption, and observability. Benefits: *  Software to manage cross-cutting concerns can be purchased off the shelf or implemented and maintained by a specialist team that does nothing else, allowing developers of the business logic to focus on only that concern.
