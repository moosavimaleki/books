*  Maintainability. Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers. *  Portability. Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product, or component can be transferred from one hardware, software, or other operational or usage environment to another. In ISO 25010, these “quality characteristics” are each composed of “quality sub-characteristics” (for example, nonrepudiation is a sub-characteristic of security). The standard slogs through almost five dozen separate descriptions of quality sub-characteristics in this way. It defines for us the qualities of “pleasure and “comfort.” It distinguishes between “functional correctness” and “functional completeness,” and then adds “functional appropriateness” for good measure. To exhibit “compatibility,” systems must either have “interoperability” or just plain “coexistence.” “Usability” is a product quality, not a quality-in-use quality, although it includes “satisfaction,” which is a quality-in-use quality. “Modifiability” and “testability” are both part of “maintainability.” So is “modularity,” which is a strategy for achieving a quality rather than a goal in its own right. “Availability” is part of “reliability.” “Interoperability” is part of “compatibility.” And “scalability” isn’t mentioned at all.
