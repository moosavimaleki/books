*  Out of sequence. A sequence of events arrive, but not in the prescribed order. Safety is also concerned with detecting and recovering from these unsafe states to prevent or at least minimize resulting harm. Any portion of the system can lead to an unsafe state: The software, the hardware portions, or the environment can behave in an unanticipated, unsafe fashion. Once an unsafe state is detected, the potential system responses are similar to those enumerated for availability (in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)). The unsafe state should be recognized and the system should be made safe through *  Continuing operations after recovering from the unsafe state or placing the system in a safe mode, or *  Shutting down (fail safe), or *  Transitioning to a state requiring manual operation (e.g., manual steering if the power steering in a car fails). In addition, the unsafe state should be reported immediately and/or logged. Architecting for safety begins by identifying the system’s safety-critical functions—those functions that could cause harm as just outlined—using techniques such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA; also called hazard analysis) and fault tree analysis (FTA). FTA is a top-down deductive approach to identify failures that could result in moving the system into an unsafe state. Once the failures have been identified, the architect needs to design mechanisms to detect and mitigate the fault (and ultimately the hazard).
