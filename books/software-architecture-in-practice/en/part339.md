5. A fundamental difference between interaction mechanisms is whether interaction is synchronous or asynchronous. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each with respect to each of these performance responses: latency, deadline, throughput, jitter, miss rate, data loss, or any other required performance-related response you may be used to. 6. Find physical-world (that is, non-software) examples of applying each of the manage resources tactics. For example, suppose you were managing a brick-and-mortar big-box retail store. How would you get people through the checkout lines faster using these tactics? 7. User interface frameworks typically are single-threaded. Why is this? What are the performance implications? (Hint: Think about race conditions.)
