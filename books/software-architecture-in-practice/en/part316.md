*  Introduce concurrency. If requests can be processed in parallel, the blocked time can be reduced. Concurrency can be introduced by processing different streams of events on different threads or by creating additional threads to process different sets of activities. (Once concurrency has been introduced, you can choose scheduling policies to achieve the goals you find desirable using the schedule resources tactic.) *  Maintain multiple copies of computations. This tactic reduces the contention that would occur if all requests for service were allocated to a single instance. Replicated services in a microservice architecture or replicated web servers in a server pool are examples of replicas of computation. A load balancer is a piece of software that assigns new work to one of the available duplicate servers; criteria for assignment vary but can be as simple as a round-robin scheme or assigning the next request to the least busy server. The load balancer pattern is discussed in detail in [Section 9.4](ch09.xhtml#ch09lev1sec4).
