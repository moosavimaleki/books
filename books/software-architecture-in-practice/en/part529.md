Load times for a container are very short—taking just a few seconds for a cold start and a few milliseconds to reallocate. Now let’s carry this one step further. Since VM allocation and loading are relatively time-consuming, potentially taking minutes to load and start the instance, you typically leave a VM instance running even if there is idle time between requests. In comparison, since the allocation of a container into a container runtime engine is fast, it is not necessary to leave the container running. We can afford to reallocate a new container instance for every request. When your service completes the processing of a request, instead of looping back to take another request, it exits, and the container stops running and is deallocated. This approach to system design is called serverless architecture—though it is not, in fact, serverless. There are servers, which host container runtime engines, but since they are allocated dynamically with each request, the servers and container runtime engines are embodied in the infrastructure. You, as a developer, are not responsible for allocating or deallocating them. The cloud service provider features that support this capability are called function-as-a-service (FaaS).
