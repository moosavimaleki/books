One common form of sandboxing is to virtualize resources. Testing a system often involves interacting with resources whose behavior is outside the system’s control. Using a sandbox, you can build a version of the resource whose behavior is under your control. For example, the system clock’s behavior is typically not under our control—it increments one second each second. Thus, if we want to make the system think it’s midnight on the day when all of the data structures are supposed to overflow, we need a way to do that, because waiting around is a poor choice. When we can abstract system time from clock time, we can allow the system (or components) to run at faster than wall-clock time, and test the system (or components) at critical time boundaries such as the next transition to or from Daylight Savings Time. Similar virtualizations could be done for other resources, such as the memory, battery, network, and so on. Stubs, mocks, and dependency injection are simple but effective forms of virtualization.
