Two different patterns for the complete replacement strategy are possible, both of which are realizations of the scale rollouts tactic. We’ll cover them both together: 1.  Blue/green. In a blue/green deployment, N new instances of the service would be created and each populated with new Service A (let’s call these the green instances). After the N instances of new Service A are installed, the DNS server or discovery service would be changed to point to the new version of Service A. Once it is determined that the new instances are working satisfactorily, then and only then are the N instances of the original Service A removed. Before this cutoff point, if a problem is found in the new version, it is a simple matter of switching back to the original (the blue services) with little or no interruption. 2.  Rolling upgrade. A rolling upgrade replaces the instances of Service A with instances of the new version of Service A one at a time. (In practice, you can replace more than one instance at a time, but only a small fraction are replaced in any single step.) The steps of the rolling upgrade are as follows:
