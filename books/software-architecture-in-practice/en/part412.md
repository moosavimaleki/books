*  A set and get method for important variables, modes, or attributes *  A report method that returns the full state of the object *  A reset method to set the internal state (e.g., all the attributes of a class) to a specified internal state *  A method to turn on verbose output, various levels of event logging, performance instrumentation, or resource monitoring *  Record/playback. The state that caused a fault is often difficult to re-create. Recording the state when it crosses an interface allows that state to be used to “play the system back” and to re-create the fault. Record refers to capturing information crossing an interface and playback refers to using it as input for further testing. *  Localize state storage. To start a system, subsystem, or component in an arbitrary state for a test, it is most convenient if that state is stored in a single place. By contrast, if the state is buried or distributed, this approach becomes difficult, if not impossible. The state can be fine-grained, even bit-level, or coarse-grained to represent broad abstractions or overall operational modes. The choice of granularity depends on how the states will be used in testing. A convenient way to “externalize” state storage (i.e., to make it amenable to manipulation through interface features) is to use a state machine (or state machine object) as the mechanism to track and report current state.
