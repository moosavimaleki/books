*  Syntactic distance. The cooperating elements must agree on the number and type of the data elements being shared. For example, if one element sends an integer and the other expects a floating point, or perhaps the bits within a data field are interpreted differently, this discrepancy presents a syntactic distance that must be bridged. Differences in data types are typically easy to observe and predict. For example, such type mismatches could be caught by a compiler. Differences in bit masks, while similar in nature, are often more difficult to detect, and the analyst may need to rely on documentation or scrutiny of the code to identify them. *  Data semantic distance. The cooperating elements must agree on the data semantics; that is, even if two elements share the same data type, their values are interpreted differently. For example, if one data value represents altitude in meters and the other represents altitude in feet, this presents a data semantic distance that must be bridged. This kind of mismatch is typically difficult to observe and predict, although the analystâ€™s life is improved somewhat if the elements involved employ metadata. Mismatches in data semantics may be discovered by comparing interface documentation or metadata descriptions, if available, or by checking the code, if available.
