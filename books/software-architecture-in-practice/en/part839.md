Evaluating and analyzing an architecture Evaluate an architecture (for your current system or for other systems) to determine the satisfaction of use cases and quality attribute scenarios. Create prototypes. Participate in design reviews. Review the designs of the components designed by junior engineers. Review designs for compliance with the architecture. Compare software architecture evaluation techniques. Model alternatives. Perform tradeoff analysis. Documenting an architecture Prepare architectural documents and presentations useful to stakeholders. Document or automate the documentation of software interfaces. Produce documentation standards or guidelines. Document variability and dynamic behavior. Working with and transforming existing system(s) Maintain and evolve an existing system and its architecture. Measure architecture debt. Migrate existing system to new technology and platforms. Refactor existing architectures to mitigate risks. Examine bugs, incident reports, and other issues to determine revisions to existing architecture. Performing other architecting duties Sell the vision. Keep the vision alive. Participate in product design meetings. Give technical advice on architecture, design, and development. Provide architectural guidelines for software design activities. Lead architecture improvement activities. Participate in software process definition and improvement. Provide architecture oversight of software development activities.
