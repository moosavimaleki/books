*  Earliest-deadline-first. Earliest-deadline-first assigns priorities based on the pending requests with the earliest deadline. *  Least-slack-first. This strategy assigns the highest priority to the job having the least “slack time,” which is the difference between the execution time remaining and the time to the job’s deadline. *  Static scheduling. A cyclic executive schedule is a scheduling strategy in which the preemption points and the sequence of assignment to the resource are determined offline. The runtime overhead of a scheduler is thereby obviated. # Performance Tactics on the Road Tactics are generic design principles. To exercise this point, think about the design of the systems of roads and highways where you live. Traffic engineers employ a bunch of design “tricks” to optimize the performance of these complex systems, where performance has a number of measures, such as throughput (how many cars per hour get from the suburbs to the football stadium), average-case latency (how long it takes, on average, to get from your house to downtown), and worst-case latency (how long does it take an emergency vehicle to get you to the hospital). What are these tricks? None other than our good old buddies, tactics.
