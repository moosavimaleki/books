2.  The matrix A must satisfy certain conditions. If it is a sparse matrix, then it likely can be processed efficiently on a quantum computer. The matrix must also be well conditioned; that is, the determinant of the matrix must be non-zero or close to zero. A small determinant causes issues when inverting a matrix on a classical computer, so this is not a quantum unique problem. 3.  The result of applying the HHL algorithm is that the x values appear in superposition. Thus a mechanism is needed for efficiently isolating the actual values from the superposition. The actual algorithm is too complicated for us to present here. One noteworthy element, however, is that it relies on an amplitude magnification technique based on using phases. ### 26.5 Potential Applications Quantum computers are expected to have an impact on a wide variety of application areas. IBM, for example, is focusing on cybersecurity, drug development, financial modeling, better batteries, cleaner fertilization, traffic optimization, weather forecasting and climate change, and artificial intelligence and machine learning, to name just a few.
