*  Compile-time parameterization *  Aspects The following tactics are available to bind values at deployment, startup time, or initialization time: *  Configuration-time binding *  Resource files Tactics to bind values at runtime include the following: *  Discovery (see [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07)) *  Interpret parameters *  Shared repositories *  Polymorphism Separating the building of a mechanism for modifiability from the use of that mechanism to make a modification admits the possibility of different stakeholders being involvedâ€”one stakeholder (usually a developer) to provide the mechanism and another stakeholder (an administrator or installer) to exercise it later, possibly in a completely different life-cycle phase. Installing a mechanism so that someone else can make a change to the system without having to change any code is sometimes called externalizing the change. ### 8.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Modifiability Based on the tactics described in [Section 8.2](ch08.xhtml#ch08lev1sec2), we can create a set of tactics-inspired questions, as presented in [Table 8.2](ch08.xhtml#ch08tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support modifiability, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
