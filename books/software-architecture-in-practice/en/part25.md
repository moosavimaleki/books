# System and Enterprise Architectures

## 1 What Is Software Architecture? We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims. —R. Buckminster Fuller Writing (on our part) and reading (on your part) a book about software architecture, which distills the experience of many people, presupposes that 1.  having a reasonable software architecture is important to the successful development of a software system and 2.  there is a sufficient body of knowledge about software architecture to fill up a book. There was a time when both of these assumptions needed justification. Early editions of this book tried to convince readers that both of these assumptions are true and, once you were convinced, supply you with basic knowledge so that you could apply the practice of architecture yourself. Today, there seems to be little controversy about either aim, and so this book is more about the supplying than the convincing. The basic principle of software architecture is every software system is constructed to satisfy an organization’s business goals, and that the architecture of a system is a bridge between those (often abstract) business goals and the final (concrete) resulting system. While the path from abstract goals to concrete systems can be complex, the good news is that software architectures can be designed, analyzed, and documented using known techniques that will support the achievement of these business goals. The complexity can be tamed, made tractable.
