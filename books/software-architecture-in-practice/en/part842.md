Leadership and team building Providing technical leadership Be a thought leader. Produce technology trend analysis or roadmaps. Mentor other architects. Building a team Build the development team and align them with the architecture vision. Mentor developers and junior architects. Educate the team on the use of the architecture. Foster the professional development of team members. Coach teams of software design engineers for planning, tracking, and completion of work within the agreed plan. Mentor and coach staff in the use of software technologies. Maintain morale, both within and outside the architecture group. Monitor and manage team dynamics. Architects also routinely perform many other duties, such as leading code reviews or getting involved in test planning. In many projects, architects pitch in to help with the actual implementation and testing, in critical areas. While important, these are not strictly speaking architectural duties. #### Skills Given the wide range of duties enumerated in the previous section, which skills does an architect need to possess? Much has been written about the architectâ€™s special role of leadership in a project; the ideal architect is an effective communicator, manager, team builder, visionary, and mentor. Some certificate or certification programs emphasize nontechnical skills. Common to these certification programs are assessment areas of leadership, organization dynamics, and communication.
