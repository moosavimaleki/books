#### Entanglement Entanglement is one of the key elements of quantum computing. It has no analog in classical computing, and gives quantum computing some of its very strange and wondrous properties, allowing it to do what classical computers cannot. Two qubits are said to be “entangled” if, when measured, the second qubit measurement matches the measurement of the first. Entanglement can occur no matter the amount of time between the two measurements, or the physical distance between the qubits. This leads us to what is called quantum teleportation. Buckle up. ### 26.2 Quantum Teleportation Recall that it is not possible to copy one qubit to another directly. Thus, if we want to copy one qubit to another, we must use indirect means. Furthermore, we must accept the destruction of the state of the original qubit. The recipient qubit will have the same state as the original, destroyed qubit. Quantum teleportation is the name given to this copying of the state. There is no requirement that the original qubit and the recipient qubit have any physical relationship, nor are there constraints on the distance that separates them. In consequence, it is possible to transfer information over great distances, even hundreds or thousands of kilometers, between qubits that have been physically implemented.
