This chapter provides some systematic techniques for identifying the ASRs and other factors that will shape the architecture. ### 19.1 Gathering ASRs from Requirements Documents An obvious location to look for candidate ASRs is in the requirements document or in user stories. After all, we are looking for requirements, and requirements should be (duh) in requirements documents. Unfortunately, this is not usually the case, although information in the requirements documents can certainly be useful. #### Don’t Get Your Hopes Up Many projects don’t create or maintain the kind of requirements document that professors in software engineering classes or authors of traditional software engineering books love to prescribe. Furthermore, no architect just sits and waits until the requirements are “finished” before starting work. The architect must begin while the requirements are still in flux. Consequently, the QA requirements are quite likely to be uncertain when the architect starts work. Even where they exist and are stable, requirements documents often fail an architect in two ways:
