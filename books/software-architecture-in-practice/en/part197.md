Patterns for deployability can be organized into two categories. The first category contains patterns for structuring services to be deployed. The second category contains patterns for how to deploy services, which can be parsed into two broad subcategories: all-or-nothing or partial deployment. The two main categories for deployability are not completely independent of each other, because certain deployment patterns depend on certain structural properties of the services. #### Patterns for Structuring Services ##### Microservice Architecture The microservice architecture pattern structures the system as a collection of independently deployable services that communicate only via messages through service interfaces. There is no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. Services are usually stateless, and (because they are developed by a single relatively small team[4](ch05.xhtml#ch05fn4a)) are relatively small—hence the term microservice. Service dependencies are acyclic. An integral part of this pattern is a discovery service so that messages can be appropriately routed.
