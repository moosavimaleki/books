![Three figures are depicted for the original interface, extending the interface, and using an intermediary.](graphics/15fig01.jpg) Figure 15.1 (a) The original interface. (b) Extending the interface. (c) Using an intermediary. The illustrations of the original interface, extending the interface, and using an intermediary are presented horizontally. The original interface shows a rounded rectangle block representing an element. Above the element, the original interface is represented through a rectangle. The blocks of actor 1 up to actor N are shown horizontally above. They are interchangeably connected to the original interface. Extending the interface shows a rounded rectangle block representing an element. Above the element, the original interface and interface extension are represented through a rectangle on the left and right. The blocks of actor 1 up to actor N are shown horizontally above. They are interchangeably connected to the original interface and the interface extension. Using an intermediary shows a rounded rectangle block representing an element. Above the element, the internal interface is represented through a rectangle. Above the internal interface, the mediator that translated between external interfaces and internal interfaces is represented through a rectangle. Above this, the original interface and interface extension are represented through a rectangle on the left and right. The blocks of actor 1 up to actor N are shown horizontally above. They are interchangeably connected to the original interface and the interface extension.
