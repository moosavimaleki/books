Benefits: *  Any failure of a server is invisible to clients (assuming there are still some remaining processing resources). *  By sharing the load among several providers, latency can be kept lower and more predictable for clients. *  It is relatively simple to add more resources (more servers, faster servers) to the pool available to the load balancer, and no client needs to be aware of this. Tradeoffs: *  The load balancing algorithm must be very fast; otherwise, it may itself contribute to performance problems. *  The load balancer is a potential bottleneck or single point of failure, so it is itself often replicated (and even load balanced). Load balancers are discussed in much more detail in [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17). #### Throttling The throttling pattern is a packaging of the manage work requests tactic. It is used to limit access to some important resource or service. In this pattern, there is typically an intermediary—a throttler—that monitors (requests to) the service and determines whether an incoming request can be serviced.
