*  A tool that calculates the debt associated with each hotspot The only specialized tools needed for this process are the ones to build the DSM and analyze the DSM. Projects likely already have issue tracking systems and revision histories, and plenty of reverse-engineering tools are available, including open source options. ### 23.5 Summary This chapter has presented a process for identifying and quantifying architecture debt in a project. Architecture debt is an important and highly costly form of technical debt. Compared to code-based technical debt, architecture debt is often harder to identify because its root causes are distributed among several files and their interrelationships. The process outlined in this chapter involves gathering information from the project’s issue tracker, its revision control system, and the source code itself. Using this information, architecture anti-patterns can be identified and grouped into hotspots, and the impact of these hotspots can be quantified. This architecture debt monitoring process can be automated and built into a system’s continuous integration tool suite. Once architecture debt has been identified, if it is bad enough, it should be removed through refactoring. The output of this process provides the quantitative data necessary to make the business case for refactoring to project management.
