*  The granularity of resources provided by an element may be different than an actor needs. A gateway can translate between elements and actors. *  Actors may need access to, or be restricted to, specific subsets of the resources. *  The specifics of the resources—their number, protocol, type, location, and properties—may change over time, and the gateway can provide a more stable interface. ![An illustration of a gateway providing access to resources.](graphics/15fig02.jpg) Figure 15.2 A gateway that provides access to a variety of different resources A figure depicts the gateway access of different resources. The key for the figure is displayed on the right as follows. The star represents the resource. The vertical double-headed arrow represents the interaction. The rounded rectangle represents an element. The illustration is as follows. An element in the bottom left has three resources. Another element on the bottom right has a single resource. These two elements interact with an element with a single resource at the top. To the left of this element, another element with two resources is presented. These two elements interact with a gateway element above. The elements from actor 1 up to actor N are shown above horizontally. These elements interact with the gateway element below.
