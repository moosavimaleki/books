# “What Happens When I Push This Button?”: Architecture as a Vehicle for Stakeholder Communication The project review droned on and on. The government-sponsored development was behind schedule and over budget, and it was large enough that these lapses were attracting the U.S. Congress’s attention. And now the government was making up for past neglect by holding a marathon come-one-come-all review session. The contractor had recently undergone a buyout, which hadn’t helped matters. It was the afternoon of the second day, and the agenda called for presentation of the software architecture. The young architect—an apprentice to the chief architect for the system—was bravely explaining how the software architecture for the massive system would enable it to meet its very demanding real-time, distributed, high-reliability requirements. He had a solid presentation and a solid architecture to present. It was sound and sensible. But the audience—about 30 government representatives who had varying roles in the management and oversight of this sticky project—was tired. Some of them were even thinking that perhaps they should have gone into real estate instead of enduring another one of these marathon let’s-finally-get-it-right-this-time reviews.
