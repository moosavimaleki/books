#### Manage Deployment Pipeline *  Scale rollouts. Rather than deploying to the entire user base, scaled rollouts deploy a new version of a service gradually, to controlled subsets of the user population, often with no explicit notification to those users. (The remainder of the user base continues to use the previous version of the service.) By gradually releasing, the effects of new deployments can be monitored and measured and, if necessary, rolled back. This tactic minimizes the potential negative impact of deploying a flawed service. It requires an architectural mechanism (not part of the service being deployed) to route a request from a user to either the new or old service, depending on that user’s identity. *  Roll back. If it is discovered that a deployment has defects or does not meet user expectations, then it can be “rolled back” to its prior state. Since deployments may involve multiple coordinated updates of multiple services and their data, the rollback mechanism must be able to keep track of all of these, or must be able to reverse the consequences of any update made by a deployment, ideally in a fully automated fashion.
