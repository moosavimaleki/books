2. Based on the business goals you uncovered for question 1, propose a set of corresponding ASRs. 3. Create a utility tree for an ATM. (Interview some of your friends and colleagues if you would like to have them contribute QA considerations and scenarios.) Consider a minimum of four different QAs. Ensure that the scenarios that you create at the leaf nodes have explicit responses and response measures. 4. Find a software requirements specification that you consider to be of high quality. Using colored pens (real ones if the document is printed; virtual ones if the document is online), color red all the material that you find completely irrelevant to a software architecture for that system. Color yellow all of the material that you think might be relevant, but not without further discussion and elaboration. Color green all of the material that you are certain is architecturally significant. When you’re done, every part of the document that’s not white space should be red, yellow, or green. Approximately what percentage of each color did your document end up being? Do the results surprise you?
