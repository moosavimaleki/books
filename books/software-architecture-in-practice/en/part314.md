*  Co-locate communicating resources. Context switching and intercomponent communication costs add up, especially when the components are on different nodes on a network. One strategy for reducing computational overhead is to co-locate resources. Co-location may mean hosting cooperating components on the same processor to avoid the time delay of network communication; it may mean putting the resources in the same runtime software component to avoid even the expense of a subroutine call; or it may mean placing tiers of a multi-tier architecture on the same rack in the data center. *  Periodic cleaning. A special case when reducing computational overhead is to perform a periodic cleanup of resources that have become inefficient. For example, hash tables and virtual memory maps may require recalculation and reinitialization. Many system administrators and even regular computer users do a periodic reboot of their systems for exactly this reason. *  Bound execution times. You can place a limit on how much execution time is used to respond to an event. For iterative, data-dependent algorithms, limiting the number of iterations is a method for bounding execution times. The cost, however, is usually a less accurate computation. If you adopt this tactic, you will need to assess its effect on accuracy and see if the result is “good enough.” This resource management tactic is frequently paired with the manage sampling rate tactic.
