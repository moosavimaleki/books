Bonnie John and Len Bass have investigated the relation between usability and software architecture. They have enumerated approximately two dozen usability scenarios that have architectural impact and given associated patterns for these scenarios [[Bass 03](ref01.xhtml#ref_13)]. Greg Hartman has defined attentiveness as the system’s ability to support user initiative and allow cancel or pause/resume [[Hartman 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_110)]. ### 13.6 Discussion Questions 1. Write a concrete usability scenario for your automobile that specifies how long it takes you to set your favorite radio stations. Now consider another part of the driver experience and create scenarios that test other aspects of the response measures from the general scenario table ([Table 13.1](ch13.xhtml#ch13tab01)). 2. How might usability trade off against security? How might it trade off against performance? 3. Pick a few of your favorite websites that do similar things, such as social networking or online shopping. Now pick one or two appropriate responses from the usability general scenario (such as “anticipate the user’s need”) and an appropriate corresponding response measure. Using the response and response measure you chose, compare the websites’ usability.
