*  Developer of an element using the interface. Needs to understand the interfaceâ€™s contract and how to use it. Such developers can provide input to the interface design and documentation process in terms of use cases that the interface should support. *  Systems integrator and tester. Puts the system together from its constituent elements and has a strong interest in the behavior of the resulting assembly. This role needs detailed information about all the resources and functionality provided by and required by an element. *  Analyst. This role depends on the types of analyses conducted. For a performance analyst, for example, the interface documentation should include a service level agreement (SLA) guarantee, so that actors can adjust their requests appropriately. *  Architect looking for assets to reuse in a new system. Often starts by examining the interfaces of elements from a previous system. The architect may also look in the commercial marketplace to find off-the-shelf elements that can be purchased and do the job. To see whether an element is a candidate, the architect is interested in the capabilities of the interface resources, their quality attributes, and any variability that the element provides.
