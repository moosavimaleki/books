This practice gained attention in the early 2000s through the ideas of Alistair Cockburn and his notion of a “walking skeleton.” More recently, it has been adopted by those employing MVP (minimum viable product) as a strategy for risk reduction. The benefits of incremental development include a reduction of the potential risk in the project. If the architecture is for a family of related systems, the infrastructure can be reused across the family, lowering the per-system cost of each. ### 2.9 Cost and Schedule Estimates Cost and schedule estimates are an important tool for the project manager. They help the project manager acquire the necessary resources as well as monitor progress on the project. One of the duties of an architect is to help the project manager create cost and schedule estimates early in the project’s life cycle. While top-down estimates are useful for setting goals and apportioning budgets, cost estimations based on a bottom-up understanding of the system’s pieces are typically more accurate than those based purely on top-down system knowledge.
