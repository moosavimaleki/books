The manage resource tactic works by reducing the resource distance between a system S and a component C, by clearly exposing the resource requirements and managing their common use. ### 7.4 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Integrability Based on the tactics described in [Section 7.3](ch07.xhtml#ch07lev1sec3), we can create a set of integrability tacticsâ€“inspired questions, as presented in [Table 7.2](ch07.xhtml#ch07tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support integrability, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
