#### Development Distributability Development distributability is the quality of designing the software to support distributed software development. Like modifiability, this quality is measured in terms of the activities of a development project. Many systems these days are developed using globally distributed teams. One problem that must be overcome when adopting this approach is coordinating the teams’ activities. The system should be designed so that coordination among teams is minimized—that is, the major subsystems should exhibit low coupling. This minimal coordination needs to be achieved both for the code and for the data model. Teams working on modules that communicate with each other may need to negotiate the interfaces of those modules. When a module is used by many other modules, each developed by a different team, communication and negotiation become more complex and burdensome. Thus the architectural structure and the social (and business) structure of the project need to be reasonably aligned. Similar considerations apply for the data model. Scenarios for development distributability will deal with the compatibility of the communication structures and data model of the system being developed and the coordination mechanisms utilized by the organizations doing the development.
