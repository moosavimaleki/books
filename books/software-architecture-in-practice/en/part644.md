#### Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions At this point, you have finished performing the design activities for the iteration. However, you may have not taken any actions to ensure that the views—the representations of the structures you created—are preserved. For instance, if you performed step 5 in a conference room, you probably ended up with a series of diagrams on a whiteboard. This information is essential to the rest of the process, and you must capture it so that you can later analyze and communicate it to other stakeholders. Capturing the views may be as simple as taking a picture of the whiteboard. The views that you have created are almost certainly not complete; thus, these diagrams may need to be revisited and refined in a subsequent iteration. This is typically done to accommodate elements resulting from other design decisions that you will make to support additional drivers. This is why we speak of “sketching” the views in ADD, where a “sketch” refers to a preliminary type of documentation. The more formal, more fully fleshed-out documentation of these views—should you choose to produce it (see [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22))—occurs only after the design iterations have been finished (as part of the architectural documentation activity).
