The granddaddy of papers about architecture and organization is by [[Conway 68](ref01.xhtml#ref_69)]. Conway’s law states that “organizations which design systems . . . are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” Cockburn’s notion of the walking skeleton is described in Agile Software Development: The Cooperative Game [[Cockburn 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_68)]. A good example of an open systems architecture standard is AUTOSAR, developed for the automotive industry ([autosar.org](http://autosar.org)). For a comprehensive treatment on building software product lines, see [[Clements 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_66)]. Feature-based product line engineering is a modern, automation-centered approach to building product lines that expands the scope from software to systems engineering. A good summary may be found at [[INCOSE 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_127)]. ### 2.16 Discussion Questions 1. If you remember nothing else from this book, remember . . . what? Extra credit for not peeking. 2. For each of the 13 reasons why architecture is important articulated in this chapter, take the contrarian position: Propose a set of circumstances under which architecture is not necessary to achieve the result indicated. Justify your position. (Try to come up with different circumstances for each of the 13 reasons.)
