The documentation of any software architecture is unlikely to be complete without at least one module view. [Table 22.1](ch22.xhtml#ch22tab01) summarizes the characteristics of module views. Table 22.1 Summary of Module Views Elements Modules, which are implementation units of software that provide a coherent set of responsibilities Relations *  Is-part-of, which defines a part/whole relationship between the submodule (the part) and the aggregate module (the whole) *  Depends-on, which defines a dependency relationship between two modules *  Is-a, which defines a generalization/specialization relationship between a more specific module (the child) and a more general module (the parent) Constraints Different module views may impose topological constraints, such as limitations on the visibility between modules. Usage *  Blueprint for construction of the code *  Analysis of the impact of changes *  Planning incremental development *  Requirements traceability analysis *  Communicating the functionality of a system and the structure of its code base *
