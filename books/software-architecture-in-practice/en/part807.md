### 23.7 Discussion Questions 1. How would you distinguish a project with architecture debt from a “busy” project where lots of features are being implemented? 2. Find examples of projects that have undergone major refactorings. What evidence was used to motivate or justify these refactorings? 3. Under what circumstances is accumulating debt a reasonable strategy? How would you know that you had reached the point of too much debt? 4. Is architecture debt more or less detrimental than other kinds of debt, such as code debt, documentation debt, or testing debt? 5. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of doing this kind of architecture analysis as compared with the methods discussed in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21).
