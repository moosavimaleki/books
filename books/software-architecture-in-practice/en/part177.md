This is not desirable, or even possible, in all domains. If your software exists in a complex ecosystem with many dependencies, it may not be possible to release just one part of it without coordinating that release with the other parts. In addition, many embedded systems, systems in hard-to-access locations, and systems that are not networked would be poor candidates for a continuous deployment mindset. This chapter focuses on the large and growing numbers of systems for which just-in-time feature releases are a significant competitive advantage, and just-in-time bug fixes are essential to safety or security or continuous operation. Often these systems are microservice and cloud-based, although the techniques here are not limited to those technologies. ### 5.1 Continuous Deployment Deployment is a process that starts with coding and ends with real users interacting with the system in a production environment. If this process is fully automated—that is, if there is no human intervention—then it is called continuous deployment. If the process is automated up to the point of placing (portions of) the system into production and human intervention is required (perhaps due to regulations or policies) for this final step, the process is called continuous delivery.
