Fortunately, it is possible to make quality predictions about a system based solely on an evaluation of its architecture. If we know that certain kinds of architectural decisions lead to certain quality attributes in a system, then we can make those decisions and rightly expect to be rewarded with the associated quality attributes. After the fact, when we examine an architecture, we can determine whether those decisions have been made and confidently predict that the architecture will exhibit the associated qualities. This point and the previous point, taken together, mean that architecture largely determines system qualities and—even better!—we know how it does so, and we know how to make it do so. Even if you don’t perform the quantitative analytic modeling sometimes necessary to ensure that an architecture will deliver its prescribed benefits, this principle of evaluating decisions based on their quality attribute implications is invaluable for at least spotting potential trouble early.
