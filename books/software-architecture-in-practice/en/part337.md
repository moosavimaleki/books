Tradeoffs: *  If you do not have large data sets, the overhead incurred by the map-reduce pattern is not justified. *  If you cannot divide your data set into similarly sized subsets, the advantages of parallelism are lost. *  Operations that require multiple reduces are complex to orchestrate. ### 9.5 For Further Reading Performance is the subject of a rich body of literature. Here are some books we recommend as general overviews of performance: *  Foundations of Software and System Performance Engineering: Process, Performance Modeling, Requirements, Testing, Scalability, and Practice [[Bondi 14](ref01.xhtml#ref_38)]. This book provides a comprehensive overview of performance engineering, ranging from technical practices to organizational ones. *  Software Performance and Scalability: A Quantitative Approach [[Liu 09](ref01.xhtml#ref_167)]. This book covers performance geared toward enterprise applications, with an emphasis on queueing theory and measurement. *  Performance Solutions: A Practical Guide to Creating Responsive, Scalable Software [[Smith 01](ref01.xhtml#ref_231)]. This book covers designing with performance in mind, with emphasis on building (and populating with real data) practical predictive performance models.
