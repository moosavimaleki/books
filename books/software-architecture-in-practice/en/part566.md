##### Autoscaling Containers Because containers are executing on runtime engines that are hosted on VMs, scaling containers involves two different types of decisions. When scaling VMs, an autoscaler decides that additional VMs are required, and then allocates a new VM and loads it with the appropriate software. Scaling containers means making a two-level decision. First, decide that an additional container (or Pod) is required for the current workload. Second, decide whether the new container (or Pod) can be allocated on an existing runtime engine instance or whether a new instance must be allocated. If a new instance must be allocated, you need to check whether a VM with sufficient capacity is available or if an additional VM needs to be allocated. The software that controls the scaling of containers is independent of the software that controls the scaling of VMs. This allows the scaling of containers to be portable across different cloud providers. It is possible that the evolution of containers will integrate the two types of scaling. In such a case, you should be aware that you may be creating a dependency between your software and the cloud provider that could be difficult to break.
