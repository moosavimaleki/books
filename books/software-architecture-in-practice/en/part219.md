### 6.2 Tactics for Energy Efficiency An energy efficiency scenario is catalyzed by the desire to conserve or manage energy while still providing the required (albeit not necessarily full) functionality. This scenario is successful if the energy responses are achieved within acceptable time, cost, and quality constraints. We illustrate this simple relationship—and hence the goal of energy efficiency tactics—in [Figure 6.2](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig02). ![The tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the energy savings objective. The response is the energy responses realized within constraints.](graphics/06fig02.jpg) Figure 6.2 Goal of energy efficiency tactics Energy efficiency is, at its heart, about effectively utilizing resources. We group the tactics into three broad categories: resource monitoring, resource allocation, and resource adaptation ([Figure 6.3](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig03)). By “resource,” we mean a computational device that consumes energy while providing its functionality. This is analogous to the definition of a hardware resource in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), which includes CPUs, data stores, network communications, and memory.
