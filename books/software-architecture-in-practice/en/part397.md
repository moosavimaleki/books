Good books on engineering systems for security include Ross Anderson’s Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, third edition [[Anderson 20](ref01.xhtml#ref_4)], and the series of books by Bruce Schneier. Different domains have different sets of security practices that are relevant to their domain. The Payment Card Industry (PCI), for example, has established a set of standards intended for those involved in credit card processing ([pcisecuritystandards.org](http://pcisecuritystandards.org)). The Wikipedia page on “Security Patterns” contains brief definitions of a large number of security patterns. Access control is commonly performed using a standard called OAuth. You can read about OAuth at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth). ### 11.6 Discussion Questions 1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for security for an automobile. Consider in particular how you would specify scenarios regarding control of the vehicle. 2. One of the most sophisticated attacks on record was carried out by a virus known as Stuxnet. Stuxnet first appeared in 2009, but became widely known in 2011 when it was revealed that it had apparently severely damaged or incapacitated the high-speed centrifuges involved in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Read about Stuxnet, and see if you can devise a defense strategy against it, based on the tactics described in this chapter.
