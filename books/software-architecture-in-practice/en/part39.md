2.  Module structures partition systems into implementation units, which in this book we call modules. Module structures show how a system is structured as a set of code or data units that have to be constructed or procured. Modules are assigned specific computational responsibilities and are the basis of work assignments for programming teams. In any module structure, the elements are modules of some kind (perhaps classes, packages, layers, or merely divisions of functionality, all of which are units of implementation). Modules represent a static way of considering the system. Modules are assigned areas of functional responsibility; there is less emphasis in these structures on how the resulting software manifests itself at runtime. Module implementations include packages, classes, and layers. Relations among modules in a module structure include uses, generalization (or “is-a”), and “is part of.” [Figures 1.3](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig03) and [1.4](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig04) show examples of module elements and relations, respectively, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation.
