Class patch. This kind of upgrade is applicable for targets executing object-oriented code, where the class definitions include a backdoor mechanism that enables the runtime addition of member data and functions. Hitless in-service software upgrade (ISSU). This leverages the redundant spare tactic to achieve non-service-affecting upgrades to software and associated schema. In practice, the function patch and class patch are used to deliver bug fixes, while the hitless ISSU is used to deliver new features and capabilities. *  Function patch. This kind of patch, which is used in procedural programming, employs an incremental linker/loader to store an updated software function into a pre-allocated segment of target memory. The new version of the software function will employ the entry and exit points of the deprecated function. *  Class patch. This kind of upgrade is applicable for targets executing object-oriented code, where the class definitions include a backdoor mechanism that enables the runtime addition of member data and functions.
