*  Package cycle. Two or more packages depend on each other, rather than forming a hierarchical structure, as they should. Detecting this anti-pattern is similar to detecting a clique: A package cycle is determined by discovering packages that form a strongly connected graph. *  Crossing. A file has both a high number of dependent files and a high number of files on which it depends, and it changes frequently with its dependents and the files it depends on. To determine the file at the center of a crossing, search for a file that has both high fan-in and fan-out with other files and that has substantial co-change relations with these other files. Not every file in a hotspot will be tightly coupled to every other file. Instead, a collection of files may be tightly coupled to each other and decoupled from other files. Each such collection is a potential hotspot and is a potential candidate for debt removal, through refactoring.
