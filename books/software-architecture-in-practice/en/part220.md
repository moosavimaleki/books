![A flowchart of the energy efficiency tactics.](graphics/06fig03.jpg) Figure 6.3 Energy efficiency tactics The energy efficiency tactics is depicted as a chart. The energy efficiency tactics is divided into monitor resources, allocate resources, and reduce resource demand. The monitor resources lists the following: metering, static classification, and dynamic classification. The allocate resources list the following: reduce usage, discovery, and schedule resources. The reduce resource demand lists the following: manage event arrival, limit event response, prioritize events, reduce computational overhead, bound execution times, increase resource usage efficiency. #### Monitor Resources You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and so we begin with resource monitoring. The tactics for resource monitoring are metering, static classification, and dynamic classification. *  Metering. The metering tactic involves collecting data about the energy consumption of computational resources via a sensor infrastructure, in near real time. At the coarsest level, the energy consumption of an entire data center can be measured from its power meter. Individual servers or hard drives can be measured using external tools such as amp meters or watt-hour meters, or using built-in tools such as those provided with metered rack PDUs (power distribution units), ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), and so forth. In battery-operated systems, the energy remaining in a battery can be determined through a battery management system, which is a component of modern batteries.
