As this edition was going to publication, Boeing was still reeling from the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft after two crashes that appear to have been caused at least partly by a piece of software called MCAS, which pushed the aircraft’s nose down at the wrong time. Faulty sensors seem to be involved here, too, as well as a baffling design decision that caused the software to rely on only one sensor to determine its behavior, instead of the two available on the aircraft. It also appears that Boeing never tested the software in question under the conditions of a sensor failure. The company did provide a way to disable the system in flight, although remembering how to do that when your airplane is doing its best to kill you may be asking a lot of a flight crew—especially when they were never made aware of the existence of the MCAS in the first place. In total, 346 people died in the two crashes of the 737 MAX.
