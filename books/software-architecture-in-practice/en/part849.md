Organizations have duties, skills, and knowledge for architecture, just like individual architects. For example, adequately funding the architecture effort is an organizational duty, as is effectively using the available architecture workforce (by appropriate teaming and other means). These are organizational duties because they are outside the control of individual architects. An organization-level skill might be effective knowledge management or human resource management as applied to architects. An example of organizational knowledge is the composition of an architecture-based life-cycle model that software projects may employ. Here are some things—duties—that an organization could perform to help improve the success of its architecture efforts: *  Personnel-related: Hire talented architects. Establish a career track for architects. Make the position of architect highly regarded through visibility, rewards, and prestige. Have architects join professional organizations. Establish an architect certification program. Establish a mentoring program for architects. Establish an architecture training and education program. Measure architects’ performance.
