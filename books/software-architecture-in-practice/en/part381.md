![A sample security scenario is presented.](graphics/11fig01.jpg) Figure 11.1 Sample scenario for security The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a disgruntled employee at a remote location. The stimulus attempts to improperly modify the pay rate table. The artifact is the database. The environment is the normal operations. The response is the unauthorized access detected and the system maintains an audit trail. The response measure is correct data is restored within one day. ### 11.2 Tactics for Security One method for thinking about how to achieve security in a system is to focus on physical security. Secure installations permit only limited access to them (e.g., by using fences and security checkpoints), have means of detecting intruders (e.g., by requiring legitimate visitors to wear badges), have deterrence mechanisms (e.g., by having armed guards), have reaction mechanisms (e.g., automatic locking of doors), and have recovery mechanisms (e.g., off-site backup). These lead to our four categories of tactics: detect, resist, react, and recover. The goal of security tactics is shown in [Figure 11.2](ch11.xhtml#ch11fig02), and [Figure 11.3](ch11.xhtml#ch11fig03) outlines these categories of tactics.
