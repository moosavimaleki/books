For example, a stakeholder may ask for 24/7 availability—who wouldn’t want that? However, the architect can explain how much that requirement is likely to cost, which will give the stakeholders information to make a tradeoff between availability and affordability. Also, architects are the only people in the conversation who can say, “I can actually deliver an architecture that will do better than what you had in mind—would that be useful to you?” Interviewing the relevant stakeholders is the surest way to learn what they know and need. Once again, it behooves a project to capture this critical information in a systematic, clear, and repeatable way. Gathering this information from stakeholders can be achieved by many methods. One such method is the Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW), described in the sidebar. # The Quality Attribute Workshop The QAW is a facilitated, stakeholder-focused method to generate, prioritize, and refine quality attribute scenarios before the software architecture is completed. It emphasizes system-level concerns and specifically the role that software will play in the system. The QAW is keenly dependent on the participation of system stakeholders.
