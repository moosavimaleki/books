Thus the set of architectural structures is neither fixed nor limited. What is architectural depends on what is useful to reason about in your context for your system. #### Architecture Is an Abstraction Since architecture consists of structures, and structures consist of elements[1](ch01.xhtml#ch01fn1a) and relations, it follows that an architecture comprises software elements and how those elements relate to each other. This means that architecture specifically and intentionally omits certain information about elements that is not useful for reasoning about the system. Thus an architecture is foremost an abstraction of a system that selects certain details and suppresses others. In all modern systems, elements interact with each other by means of interfaces that partition details about an element into public and private parts. Architecture is concerned with the public side of this division; private details of elements—details having to do solely with internal implementation—are not architectural. This abstraction is essential to taming the complexity of an architecture: We simply cannot, and do not want to, deal with all of the complexity all of the time. We want—and need—the understanding of a system’s architecture to be many orders of magnitude easier than understanding every detail about that system. You can’t keep every detail of a system of even modest size in your head; the point of architecture is to make it so you don’t have to.
