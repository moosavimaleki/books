The response is faults detected.](graphics/12fig03.jpg) Figure 12.3 The goal of testability tactics There are two categories of tactics for testability. The first category deals with adding controllability and observability to the system. The second deals with limiting complexity in the system’s design. #### Control and Observe System State Control and observation are so central to testability that some authors define testability in those terms. The two go hand in hand; it makes no sense to control something if you can’t observe what happens when you do. The simplest form of control and observation is to provide a software component with a set of inputs, let it do its work, and then observe its outputs. However, the control-and-observe category of testability tactics provides insights into software that go beyond its inputs and outputs. These tactics cause a component to maintain some sort of state information, allow testers to assign a value to that state information, and make that information accessible to testers on demand. The state information might be an operating state, the value of some key variable, performance load, intermediate process steps, or anything else useful to re-creating component behavior. Specific tactics include the following:
