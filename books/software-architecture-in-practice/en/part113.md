*  Stimulus source. A stimulus must have a source—it must come from somewhere. Some entity (a human, a computer system, or any other actor) must have generated the stimulus. The source of the stimulus may affect how it is treated by the system. A request from a trusted user will not undergo the same scrutiny as a request by an untrusted user. *  Response. The response is the activity that occurs as the result of the arrival of the stimulus. The response is something the architect undertakes to satisfy. It consists of the responsibilities that the system (for runtime qualities) or the developers (for development-time qualities) should perform in response to the stimulus. For example, in a performance scenario, an event arrives (the stimulus) and the system should process that event and generate a response. In a modifiability scenario, a request for a modification arrives (the stimulus) and the developers should implement the modification—without side effects—and then test and deploy the modification.
