Finally, some architectural patterns lend themselves to testability. In a layered pattern, you can test lower layers first, then test higher layers with confidence in the lower layers. *  Limit the number of classes from which a class is derived, or the number of classes derived from a class. *  Limit the depth of the inheritance tree, and the number of children of a class. *  Limit polymorphism and dynamic calls. *  Limit nondeterminism. The counterpart to limiting structural complexity is limiting behavioral complexity. When it comes to testing, nondeterminism is a pernicious form of complex behavior, and nondeterministic systems are more difficult to test than deterministic systems. This tactic involves finding all the sources of nondeterminism, such as unconstrained parallelism, and weeding them out to the extent possible. Some sources of nondeterminism are unavoidable—for instance, in multi-threaded systems that respond to unpredictable events—but for such systems, other tactics (such as record/playback) are available to help manage this complexity.
