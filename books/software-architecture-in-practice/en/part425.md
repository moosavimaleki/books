Tradeoffs: *  If a large amount of data is being passed to the service, this pattern can be highly inefficient and can add a nontrivial amount of latency, as each filter makes a complete pass over the entire input. ### 12.5 For Further Reading The literature on software testing would sink a battleship, but the writing about how to make your system more testable from an architectural standpoint is less voluminous. For a good overview of testing, see [[Binder 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_31)]. Jeff Voas’s foundational work on testability and the relationship between testability and reliability is worth investigating, too. There are several papers to choose from, but [[Voas 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_251)] is a good start that will point you to others. Bertolino and Strigini [[Bertolino 96a](ref01.xhtml#ref_27), [96b](ref01.xhtml#ref_28)] are the developers of the model of testing shown in [Figure 12.1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig01). “Uncle Bob” Martin has written extensively on test-driven development and the relationship between architecture and testing. The best book on this is Robert C. Martin’s Clean Architecture: A Craftsman’s Guide to Software Structure and Design [[Martin 17](ref01.xhtml#ref_174)]. An early and authoritative reference for test-driven development was written by Kent Beck: Test-Driven Development by Example [[Beck 02](ref01.xhtml#ref_20)].
