![An illustration of the architecture anti-patterns.](graphics/23fig04.jpg) Figure 23.4 Architecture anti-patterns in Apache Cassandra A figure shows the anti-pattern architecture of the Apache Cassandra. The matrix contains 18 rows and 18 columns. The rows represent different files. Dependencies are marked in several cells. The values in cells (14, 12) and (12, 14) are encircled. The value in the cell 7, 6 is squared. The majority of issues in an issue tracking system can be divided into two broad categories: bug fixes and feature enhancements. Bug fixes and both bug-related and change-related churn are highly correlated with anti-patterns and hotspots. In other words, those files that participate in anti-patterns and require frequent bug fixes or frequent changes are likely hotspots. For each file, we determine the total number of bug fixes and changes, as well as the total amount of churn that file has experienced. Next, we sum the bug fixes, changes, and churn experienced by the files in each anti-pattern. This gives us a weighting for each anti-pattern in terms of its contribution to architecture debt. In this way, all of the debt-laden files, along with all of their relationships, can be identified and their debt quantified.
