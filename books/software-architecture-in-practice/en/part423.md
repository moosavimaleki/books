*  Adding this pattern adds a small amount of up-front complexity and may require retraining of developers to think in terms of inversion of control. #### Strategy Pattern In the strategy pattern, a classâ€™s behavior can be changed at runtime. This pattern is often employed when multiple algorithms can be employed to perform a given task, and the specific algorithm to be used can be chosen dynamically. The class simply contains an abstract method for the desired functionality, with the concrete version of this method being selected based on contextual factors. This pattern is often used to replace non-test versions of some functionality with test versions that provide additional outputs, additional internal sanity checking, and so forth. Benefits: *  This pattern makes classes simpler, by not combining multiple concerns (such as different algorithms for the same function) into a single class. Tradeoffs: *  The strategy pattern, like all design patterns, adds a small amount of up-front complexity. If the class is simple or if there are few runtime choices, this added complexity is likely wasted.
