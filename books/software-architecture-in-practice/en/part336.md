*  All of the heavy analysis takes place in the reduce function. The number of reduce instances corresponds to the number of buckets output by the map function. The reduce phase does some programmer-specified analysis and then emits the results of that analysis. For example, we could count the number of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades, or we could sum the numeric values of all of the cards in each bucket. The output set is almost always much smaller than the input sets—hence the name “reduce.” The map instances are stateless and do not communicate with each other. The only communication between the map instances and the reduce instances is the data emitted from the map instances as  pairs. Benefits: *  Extremely large, unsorted data sets can be efficiently analyzed through the exploitation of parallelism. *  A failure of any instance has only a small impact on the processing, since map-reduce typically breaks large input datasets into many smaller ones for processing, allocating each to its own instance.
