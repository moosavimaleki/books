The results of stakeholder interviews should include a list of architectural drivers and a set of QA scenarios that the stakeholders (as a group) prioritized. This information can be used for the following purposes: *  Refine system and software requirements. *  Understand and clarify the system’s architectural drivers. *  Provide a rationale for why the architect subsequently made certain design decisions. *  Guide the development of prototypes and simulations. *  Influence the order in which the architecture is developed. # I Don’t Know What That Requirement Should Be It is not uncommon when interviewing stakeholders and probing for ASRs that they will complain, “I don’t know what that requirement should be.” While it is true that this is the way that they feel, it is also frequently the case that they know something about the requirement, particularly if the stakeholders are experienced in the domain. In this case, eliciting this “something” is far better than simply making up the requirement on your own. For example, you might ask, “How quickly should the system respond to this transaction request?” If the answer is “I don’t know,” my advice here is to play dumb. You can say, “So . . . 24 hours would be OK?” The response is often an indignant and astonished “No!” “Well, how about 1 hour? “No!” “Five minutes? “No!” “How about 10 seconds?” “Well,  I suppose I could live with something like that. . . .”
