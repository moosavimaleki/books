Tactics for availability—fault detection: *  Triple modular redundancy (TMR) was developed in the early 1960s by Lyons [[Lyons 62](ref01.xhtml#ref_169)]. *  The fault detection in the voting tactic is based on the fundamental contributions to automata theory by Von Neumann, who demonstrated how systems having a prescribed reliability could be built from unreliable components [[Von Neumann 56](ref01.xhtml#ref_252)]. Tactics for availability—fault recovery: *  Standards-based realizations of active redundancy exist for protecting network links (i.e., facilities) at both the physical layer of the seven-layer OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model [[Bellcore 98](ref01.xhtml#ref_23), [99](ref01.xhtml#ref_24); [Telcordia 00](ref01.xhtml#ref_240)] and the network/link layer [IETF 2005]. *  Some examples of how a system can degrade through use (degradation) are given in [[Nygard 18](ref01.xhtml#ref_196)]. *  Mountains of papers have been written about parameter typing, but [[Utas 05](ref01.xhtml#ref_243)] writes about it in the context of availability (as opposed to bug prevention, its usual context). [[Utas 05](ref01.xhtml#ref_243)] has also written about escalating restart.
