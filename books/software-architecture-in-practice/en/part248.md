A discovery service may include entries that are themselves discovery services. Likewise, entries in a discovery service may have additional attributes, which a query may reference. For example, a weather discovery service may have an attribute of “cost of forecast”; you can then ask a weather discovery service for a service that provides free forecasts. The discover tactic works by reducing the dependencies between cooperating services, which should be written without knowledge of each other. This enables flexibility in the binding between services, as well as when that binding occurs. ##### Tailor Interface Tailoring an interface is a tactic that adds capabilities to, or hides capabilities in, an existing interface without changing the API or implementation. Capabilities such as translation, buffering, and data smoothing can be added to an interface without changing it. An example of removing capabilities is hiding particular functions or parameters from untrusted users. A common dynamic application of this tactic is intercepting filters that add functionality such as data validation to help prevent SQL injections or other attacks, or to translate between data formats. Another example is using techniques from aspect-oriented programming that weave in preprocessing and postprocessing functionality at compile time.
