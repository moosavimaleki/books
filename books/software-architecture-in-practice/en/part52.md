![A figure shows the deployment structure.](graphics/01fig10.jpg) Figure 1.10 Deployment structure An illustration of the deployment structure is provided. The internet user PC is connected via the internet to the win server application server that includes a sub execution environment WebSphere. This win server application server is connected via the intranet to the Linux server database server. The win desktop admin user pc is connected to the win server application server via intranet and this is a 1 to 1 connection. The artifact app-client.jar is deployed to win desktop Admin user PC and artifact EnterpriseWebApp.ear is deployed to the win server application server. The notation used is UML. The connections are made via interfaces. *  Implementation structure. This structure shows how software elements (usually modules) are mapped to the file structures in the systemâ€™s development, integration, test, or configuration control environments. This is critical for the management of development activities and build processes.
