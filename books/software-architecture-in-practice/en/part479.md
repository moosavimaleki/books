### 15.2 Designing an Interface Decisions about which resources should be externally visible should be driven by the needs of actors that use the resources. Adding resources to an interface implies a commitment to maintain those resources as part of the interface for as long as the element will be in use. Once actors start to depend on a resource you provide, their elements will break if the resource is changed or removed. The reliability of your architecture is affected when the interface contract between elements is broken. Some additional design principles for interfaces are highlighted here: *  Principle of least surprise. Interfaces should behave consistently with the actorâ€™s expectations. Names play a role here: An aptly named resource gives actors a good hint about what the resource can be used for. *  Small interfaces principle. If two elements need to interact, have them exchange as little information as possible.
