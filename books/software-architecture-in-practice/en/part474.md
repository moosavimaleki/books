*  Events that will be signaled or messages that will be sent as a result of using the resource. *  How other resources will behave differently in the future as the result of using this resource. For example, if you ask a resource to destroy an object, trying to access that object in the future through other resources could produce an error as a result. *  Humanly observable results. These are prevalent in embedded systems. For example, calling a program that turns on a display in a cockpit has a very observable effectâ€”the display comes on. In addition, the statement of semantics should make it clear whether the execution of the resource will be atomic or may be suspended or interrupted. #### Operations, Events, and Properties The resources of provided interfaces consist of operations, events, and properties. These resources are complemented by an explicit description of the behavior caused or data exchanged when accessing each interface resource in terms of its syntax, structure, and semantics. (Without this description, how would the programmer or actor know whether or how to use the resources?)
