A side effect of establishing the work-breakdown structure is to freeze some aspects of the software architecture. A group that is responsible for one of the subsystems may resist having its responsibilities distributed across other groups. If these responsibilities have been formalized in a contractual relationship, changing responsibilities could become expensive or even litigious. Thus, once the architecture has been agreed upon, it becomes very costly—for managerial and business reasons—to significantly modify it. This is one argument (among many) for analyzing the software architecture for a large system before settling on a specific choice. ### 2.8 Enabling Incremental Development Once an architecture has been defined, it can serve as the basis for incremental development. The first increment can be a skeletal system in which at least some of the infrastructure—how the elements initialize, communicate, share data, access resources, report errors, log activity, and so forth—is present, but much of the system’s application functionality is not.
