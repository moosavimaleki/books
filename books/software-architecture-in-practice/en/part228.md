*  In cases where the inference frequently results in accessing the higher-power sensor, this pattern could result in overall higher energy usage. #### Kill Abnormal Tasks Mobile systems, because they are often executing apps of unknown provenance, may end up unknowingly running some exceptionally power-hungry apps. This pattern provides a way to monitor the energy usage of such apps and to interrupt or kill energy-greedy operations. For example, if an app is issuing an audible alert and vibrating the phone and the user is not responding to these alerts, then after a predetermined timeout period the task is killed. Benefits: *  This pattern provides a “fail-safe” option for managing the energy consumption of apps with unknown energy properties. Tradeoffs: *  Any monitoring process adds a small amount of overhead to system operations, which may affect performance and, to a small extent, energy usage. *  The usability of this pattern needs to be considered. Killing energy-hungry tasks may be counter to the user’s intention.
