For much of the history of software engineering, which began when computers were slow and expensive and the tasks to perform dwarfed the ability to do them, performance has been the driving factor in architecture. As such, it has frequently compromised the achievement of all other qualities. As the price/performance ratio of hardware continues to plummet and the cost of developing software continues to rise, other qualities have emerged as important competitors to performance. But performance remains of fundamental importance. There are still (and will likely always be) important problems that we know how to solve with computers, but that we canâ€™t solve fast enough to be useful. All systems have performance requirements, even if they are not expressed. For example, a word processing tool may not have any explicit performance requirement, but no doubt you would agree that waiting an hour (or a minute, or a second) before seeing a typed character appear on the screen is unacceptable. Performance continues to be a fundamentally important quality attribute for all software.
