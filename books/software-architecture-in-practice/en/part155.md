*  Nonstop forwarding. This concept originated in router design, and assumes that functionality is split into two parts: the supervisory or control plane (which manages connectivity and routing information) and the data plane (which does the actual work of routing packets from sender to receiver). If a router experiences the failure of an active supervisor, it can continue forwarding packets along known routes—with neighboring routers—while the routing protocol information is recovered and validated. When the control plane is restarted, it implements a “graceful restart,” incrementally rebuilding its routing protocol database even as the data plane continues to operate. #### Prevent Faults Instead of detecting faults and then trying to recover from them, what if your system could prevent them from occurring in the first place? Although it might sound as if some measure of clairvoyance would be required, it turns out that in many cases it is possible to do just that.[2](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn2a)
