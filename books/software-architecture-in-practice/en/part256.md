*  Mediators. Mediators exhibit properties of both bridges and wrappers. The major distinction between bridges and mediators, is that mediators incorporate a planning function that results in runtime determination of the translation, whereas bridges establish this translation at bridge construction time. A mediator is also similar to a wrapper insofar as it becomes an explicit component in the system architecture. That is, semantically primitive, often transient bridges can be thought of as incidental repair mechanisms whose role in a design can remain implicit. In contrast, mediators have sufficient semantic complexity and runtime autonomy (persistence) to play a first-class role in a software architecture. Benefits: *  All three patterns allow access to an element without forcing a change to the element or its interface. Tradeoffs: *  Creating any of the patterns requires up-front development work. *  All of the patterns will introduce some performance overhead while accessing the element, although typically this overhead is small.
