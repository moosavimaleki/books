*  Condition monitoring. This tactic involves checking conditions in a process or device, or validating assumptions made during the design. By monitoring conditions, this tactic prevents a system from producing faulty behavior. The computation of checksums is a common example of this tactic. However, the monitor must itself be simple (and, ideally, provably correct) to ensure that it does not introduce new software errors. *  Sanity checking. This tactic checks the validity or reasonableness of specific operations or outputs of a component. It is typically based on a knowledge of the internal design, the state of the system, or the nature of the information under scrutiny. It is most often employed at interfaces, to examine a specific information flow. *  Voting. Voting involves comparing computational results from multiple sources that should be producing the same results and, if they are not, deciding which results to use. This tactic depends critically on the voting logic, which is usually realized as a simple, rigorously reviewed, and tested singleton so that the probability of error is low. Voting also depends critically on having multiple sources to evaluate. Typical schemes include the following:
