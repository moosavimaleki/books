#### Selection of Design Concepts Once you have identified a list of alternative design concepts, you need to select which one of the alternatives is the most appropriate to solve the design problem at hand. You can achieve this in a relatively simple way, by creating a table that lists the pros and cons associated with each alternative and selecting one of the alternatives based on those criteria and your drivers. The table can also contain other criteria, such as the cost associated with the use of the alternative. Methods such as SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis can help you make this decision. When identifying and selecting design concepts, keep in mind the constraints that are part of the architectural drivers, because some constraints will restrict you from selecting particular alternatives. For example, a constraint might be that all libraries and frameworks must employ an approved license. In that case, even if you have found a framework that could be useful for your needs, you may need to discard it if it does not carry an approved license.
