Conventional RAM comprises a hardware device that takes as input a memory location and returns as output the contents of that memory location. QRAM is conceptually similar: It takes as input a memory location (likely a superposition of memory locations) and returns as output the superpositioned contents of those memory locations. The memory locations whose contents are returned were written conventionallyâ€”that is, each bit has one value. The values are returned in superposition, and the amplitudes are determined by the specification of the memory locations to be returned. Because the original values were conventionally written, they can be copied in a nondestructive fashion. A problem with the proposed QRAM is that the number of physical resources required scales linearly with the number of bits retrieved. Thus it may not be practical to construct QRAM for very large retrievals. As with much of the discussion of quantum computers, QRAM is in the theoretical discussion stage rather than the engineering phase. Stay tuned.
