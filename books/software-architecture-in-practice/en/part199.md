Tradeoffs: *  Overhead is increased, compared to in-memory communication, because all communication among services occurs via messages across a network. This can be mitigated somewhat by using the service mesh pattern (see [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09)), which constrains the deployment of some services to the same host to reduce network traffic. Furthermore, because of the dynamic nature of microservice deployments, discovery services are heavily used, adding to the overhead. Ultimately, those discovery services may become a performance bottleneck. *  Microservices are less suitable for complex transactions because of the difficulty of synchronizing activities across distributed systems. *  The freedom for every team to choose its own technology comes at a costâ€”the organization must maintain those technologies and the required experience base. *  Intellectual control of the total system may be difficult because of the large number of microservices. This introduces a requirement for catalogs and databases of interfaces to assist in maintaining intellectual control. In addition, the process of properly combining services to achieve a desired outcome may be complex and subtle.
