Benefits: *  This pattern allows for flexibility in binding services together into a cooperating whole. For example, services may be chosen at startup or runtime based on their pricing or availability. Tradeoffs: *  Dynamic discovery registration and de-registration must be automated, and tools for this purpose must be acquired or generated. ### 7.6 For Further Reading Much of the material for this chapter was inspired by and drawn from [[Kazman 20a](ref01.xhtml#ref_144)]. An in-depth discussion of the quality attribute of integrability can be found in [Hentonnen 07]. [[MacCormack 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_170)] and [[Mo 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_181)] define and provide empirical evidence for architecture-level coupling metrics, which can be useful in measuring designs for integrability. The book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software [[Gamma 94](ref01.xhtml#ref_97)] defines and distinguishes the bridge, wrapper, and adapter patterns. ### 7.7 Discussion Questions 1. Think about an integration that you have done in the past—perhaps integrating a library or a framework into your code. Identify the various “distances” that you had to deal with, as discussed in [Section 7.1](ch07.xhtml#ch07lev1sec1). Which of these required the greatest effort to resolve?
