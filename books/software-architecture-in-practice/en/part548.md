There are limits to what can be achieved with vertical scaling. In particular, there may not be a large enough VM instance type to support the workload. In this case, horizontal scaling or scaling out provides more resources of the type needed. Horizontal scaling involves having multiple copies of the same service and using a load balancer to distribute requests among them—equivalent to the maintain multiple copies of computations tactic and the load balancer pattern, respectively, from [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09). #### Distributed Computing and Load Balancers Load balancers can be standalone systems, or they can bundled with other functions. A load balancer must be very efficient because it sits in the path of every message from a client to a service, and even when it is packaged with other functions, it is logically isolated. Here, we divide our discussion into two main aspects: how load balancers work and how services that sit behind a load balancer must be designed to manage the service state. Once we understand these processes, we can explore the management of the system’s health and how load balancers can improve its availability.
