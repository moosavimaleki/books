Placing several containers into a Pod means that they are all allocated together and any communication between the containers can be done quickly. Serverless architecture allows for containers to be rapidly instantiated and moves the responsibility for allocation and deallocation to the cloud provider infrastructure. ### 16.10 For Further Reading The material in this chapter is taken from Deployment and Operations for Software Engineers [[Bass 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_17)], where you can find more detailed discussions. Wikipedia is always a good place to find current details of protocols, container runtime engines, and serverless architectures. ### 16.11 Discussion Questions 1. Create a LAMP container using Docker. Compare the size of your container image to one you find on the Internet. What is the source of the difference? Under what circumstances is this a cause of concern for you as an architect? 2. How does the container management system know that only one layer has been changed so that it needs to transport only one layer?
