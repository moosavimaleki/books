In addition, documentation is especially important in distributed development. Co-located teams have a variety of informal coordination possibilities such as going to the next office or meeting in the coffee room or the hall. Remote teams do not have these informal mechanisms available, so they must rely on more formal mechanisms such as documentation, and team members must take the initiative to talk to each other when doubts arise. As this book was being prepared for publication, companies around the world were learning to cope with remote participation and work-from-home practices due to the COVID-19 crisis. It is too soon to definitively state the long-term effects of this pandemic on the business world, but it seems likely to lead to distributed development becoming the norm. People working together are now all doing so via teleconference; there are no more hallway conversations or meetings at the vending machines. For work to continue at all, everyone is learning to adapt to the distributed development paradigm. It will be fascinating to see if this leads to any new architectural trends.
