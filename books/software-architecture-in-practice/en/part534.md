## 17 The Cloud and Distributed Computing A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. —Leslie Lamport Cloud computing is about the on-demand availability of resources. This term is used to refer to a wide range of computing capabilities. For example, you might say, “All my photos are backed up to the cloud.” But what does that mean? It means: *  My photos are stored on someone else’s computers. They worry about the capital investment and maintenance and upkeep and backups. *  My photos are accessible by me over the Internet. *  I pay only for the space that I use, or that I requisition. *  The storage service is elastic, meaning that it can grow or shrink as my needs change. *  My use of the cloud is self-provisioned: I create an account and can immediately begin using it to store my materials.
