*  Tactics. This design concept does not prescribe a particular structure. Thus, to instantiate a tactic, you may adapt a different type of design concept (that youâ€™re already using) to realize the tactic. Alternatively, you may utilize a design concept that, without any need for adaptation, already realizes the tactic. For example, you might (1) select a security tactic of authenticating actors and instantiate it through a custom-coded solution that you weave into your preexisting login process; or (2) adopt a security pattern that includes actor authentication; or (3) integrate an externally developed component such as a security framework that authenticates actors. *  Externally developed components. The instantiation of these components may or not imply the creation of new elements. For example, in the case of object-oriented frameworks, instantiation may require you to create new classes that inherit from the base classes defined in the framework. This will result in new elements. An example that does not involve the creation of new elements is specifying configuration options for a chosen technology, such as the number of threads in a thread pool.
