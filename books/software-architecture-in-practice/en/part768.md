Deployment and work assignment. *  Other. Top-level context diagrams showing interacting systems and system overview and purpose. *  Members of the development team, for whom the architecture provides marching orders, are given constraints on how they do their job. Sometimes developers are given responsibility for an element they did not implement, such as a commercial off-the-shelf product or a legacy element. Someone still has to be responsible for that element, to make sure that it performs as advertised and to tailor it as necessary. This person will want to know the following information: The general idea behind the system. Although that information lies in the realm of requirements rather than architecture, a top-level context diagram or system overview can go a long way toward providing the necessary information.
