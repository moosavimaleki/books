### 3.8 For Further Reading Some extended case studies showing how tactics and patterns are used in design can be found in [[Cervantes 16](ref01.xhtml#ref_54)]. A substantial catalog of architectural patterns can be found in the five-volume set Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, by Frank Buschmann et al. Arguments showing that many different architectures can provide the same functionality—that is, that architecture and functionality are largely orthogonal—can be found in [[Shaw 95](ref01.xhtml#ref_230)]. ### 3.9 Discussion Questions 1. What is the relationship between a use case and a quality attribute scenario? If you wanted to add quality attribute information to a use case, how would you do it? 2. Do you suppose that the set of tactics for a quality attribute is finite or infinite? Why? 3. Enumerate the set of responsibilities that an automatic teller machine should support and propose a design to accommodate that set of responsibilities. Justify your proposal. 4. Choose an architecture that you are familiar with (or choose the ATM architecture you defined in question 3) and walk through the performance tactics questionnaire (found in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09)). What insight did these questions provide into the design decisions made (or not made)?
