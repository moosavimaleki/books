*  Length of time to prepare test infrastructure *  Effort required to bring the system into a specific state *  Reduction in risk exposure: size(loss) Ã— probability(loss) [Figure 12.2](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig02) shows a concrete scenario for testability: The developer completes a code unit during development and performs a test sequence whose results are captured and that gives 85 percent path coverage within 30 minutes. ![A sample testability scenario is presented.](graphics/12fig02.jpg) Figure 12.2 Sample testability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a developer. The stimulus completes a code unit. The artifact is the code unit. The environment is the development. The response performs a test sequence. The response measure is 85 percent path coverage within 30 minutes. ### 12.2 Tactics for Testability Tactics for testability are intended to promote easier, more efficient, and more capable testing. [Figure 12.3](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig03) illustrates the goal of the testability tactics. Architectural techniques for enhancing the software testability have not received as much attention as other quality attribute disciplines such as modifiability, performance, and availability, but as we stated earlier, anything the architect can do to reduce the high cost of testing will yield a significant benefit.
