*  Hide an element of a component interface *  Preserve an element of a component’s base interface without change *  Bridges. A bridge translates some “requires” assumptions of one arbitrary component to some “provides” assumptions of another component. The key difference between a bridge and a wrapper is that a bridge is independent of any particular component. Also, the bridge must be explicitly invoked by some external agent—possibly but not necessarily by one of the components the bridge spans. This last point should convey the idea that bridges are usually transient and that the specific translation is defined at the time of bridge construction (e.g., bridge compile time). The significance of both of these distinctions will be made clear in the discussion of mediators. Bridges typically focus on a narrower range of interface translations than do wrappers because bridges address specific assumptions. The more assumptions a bridge tries to address, the fewer components to which it applies.
