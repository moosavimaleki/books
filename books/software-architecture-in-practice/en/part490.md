The most common programming-languageâ€“independent data representation styles can be divided between textual (e.g., XML or JSON) and binary (e.g., protocol buffers) options. ##### EXtensible Markup Language (XML) XML was standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1998. XML annotations to a textual document, called tags, are used to specify how to interpret the information in the document by breaking the information into chunks or fields and identifying the data type of each field. Tags can be annotated with attributes. XML is a meta-language: Out of the box, it does nothing except allow you to define a customized language to describe your data. Your customized language is defined by an XML schema, which is itself an XML document that specifies the tags you will use, the data type that should be used to interpret fields enclosed by each tag, and the constraints that apply to the structure of your document. XML schemas enable you as an architect to specify a rich information structure.
