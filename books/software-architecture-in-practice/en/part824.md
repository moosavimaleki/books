SAFe acknowledges the role of architecture. It admits “intentional architecture,” the definition of which will strike a chord with readers of this book. Intentional architecture “defines a set of purposeful, planned architectural strategies and initiatives, which enhance solution design, performance, and usability and provide guidance for inter-team design and implementation synchronization.” But SAFe also strongly counsels a counterbalancing force called “emergent design,” which “provides the technical basis for a fully evolutionary and incremental implementation approach ” ([scaledagileframework.com](http://scaledagileframework.com)). We would argue that those qualities would emerge from an intentional architecture as well, since the ability to rapidly evolve and the ability to support incremental implementations do not happen without careful up-front thought. Ways to achieve these are, in fact, covered throughout this book. ### 24.4 Architecture and Distributed Development Most substantial projects today are developed by distributed teams, where “distributed” may mean spread across floors in a building, across buildings on an industrial campus, across campuses in one or two different time zones, or among different divisions or subcontractors scattered around the globe.
