As just mentioned, the availability expected of a system or service is frequently expressed as an SLA. The SLA specifies the availability level that is guaranteed and, usually, the penalties that the provider will suffer if the SLA is violated. For example, Amazon provides the following SLA for its EC2 cloud service: AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Included Services each available for each AWS region with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.99%, in each case during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event any of the Included Services do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below. [Table 4.1](ch04.xhtml#ch04tab01) provides examples of system availability requirements and associated threshold values for acceptable system downtime, measured over observation periods of 90 days and one year. The term high availability typically refers to designs targeting availability of 99.999 percent (“5 nines”) or greater. As mentioned earlier, only unscheduled outages contribute to system downtime.
