A solution to the first two problems (untestable definitions and overlapping issues) is to use quality attribute scenarios as a means of characterizing quality attributes (see [Section 3.3](ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec3)). A solution to the third problem is to illustrate the concepts that are fundamental to that attribute community in a common form, which we do in [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[14](ch14.xhtml#ch14). We will focus on two categories of quality attributes. The first category includes those attributes that describe some property of the system at runtime, such as availability, performance, or usability. The second category includes those that describe some property of the development of the system, such as modifiability, testability, or deployability. Quality attributes can never be achieved in isolation. The achievement of any one will have an effect—sometimes positive and sometimes negative—on the achievement of others. For example, almost every quality attribute negatively affects performance. Take portability: The main technique for achieving portable software is to isolate system dependencies, which introduces overhead into the system’s execution, typically as process or procedure boundaries, which then hurts performance. Determining a design that may satisfy quality attribute requirements is partially a matter of making the appropriate tradeoffs; we discuss design in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21).
