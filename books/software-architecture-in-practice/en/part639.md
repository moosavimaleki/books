### 20.2 The Steps of ADD The sections that follow describe the steps for ADD. #### Step 1: Review Inputs Before starting a design round, you need to ensure that the architectural drivers (the inputs to the design process) are available and correct. These include: *  The purpose of the design round *  The primary functional requirements *  The primary quality attribute (QA) scenarios *  Any constraints *  Any concerns Why do we explicitly capture the design purpose? You need to make sure that you are clear about your goals for a round. In an incremental design context comprising multiple rounds, the purpose for a design round may be, for example, to produce a design for early estimation, to refine an existing design to build a new increment of the system, or to design and generate a prototype to mitigate certain technical risks. In addition, you need to know the existing architectureâ€™s design, if this is not greenfield development.
