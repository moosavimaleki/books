One of the following: *  Development *  Integration *  Deployment *  Runtime Response How will an “integrable” system respond to the stimulus? One or more of the following: *  Changes are {completed, integrated, tested, deployed} *  Components in the new configuration are successfully and correctly (syntactically and semantically) exchanging information *  Components in the new configuration are successfully collaborating *  Components in the new configuration do not violate any resource limits Response measure How is the response measured? One or more of the following: *  Cost, in terms of one or more of: Number of components changed Percentage of code changed Lines of code changed Effort Money Calendar time *  Number of components changed *  Percentage of code changed *  Lines of code changed *  Effort *  Money *  Calendar time *  Effects on other quality attribute response measures (to capture allowable tradeoffs) [Figure 7.1](ch07.xhtml#ch07fig01) illustrates a sample integrability scenario constructed from the general scenario: A new data filtering component has become available in the component marketplace. The new component is integrated into the system and deployed in 1 month, with no more than 1 person-month of effort.
