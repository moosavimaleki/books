Does the system use a predictive model to monitor the state of health of a component to ensure that the system is operating within nominal parameters? When conditions are detected that are predictive of likely future faults, the model initiates corrective action. ### 4.4 Patterns for Availability This section presents a few of the most important architectural patterns for availability. The first three patterns are all centered on the redundant spare tactic, and will be described as a group. They differ primarily in the degree to which the backup componentsâ€™ state matches that of the active component. (A special case occurs when the components are stateless, in which case the first two patterns become identical.) *  Active redundancy (hot spare). For stateful components, this refers to a configuration in which all of the nodes (active or redundant spare) in a protection group[3](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn3a) receive and process identical inputs in parallel, allowing the redundant spare(s) to maintain a synchronous state with the active node(s). Because the redundant spare possesses an identical state to the active processor, it can take over from a failed component in a matter of milliseconds. The simple case of one active node and one redundant spare node is commonly referred to as one-plus-one redundancy. Active redundancy can also be used for facilities protection, where active and standby network links are used to ensure highly available network connectivity.
