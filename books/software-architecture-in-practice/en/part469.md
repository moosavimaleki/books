An element’s actors are the other elements, users, or systems with which it interacts. The collection of actors with which an element interacts is called the environment of the element. By “interacts,” we mean anything one element does that can impact the processing of another element. This interaction is part of the element’s interface. Interactions can take a variety of forms, though most involve the transfer of control and/or data. Some are supported by standard programming-language constructs, such as local or remote procedure calls (RPCs), data streams, shared memory, and message passing. These constructs, which provide points of direct interaction with an element, are called resources. Other interactions are indirect. For example, the fact that using resource X on element A leaves element B in a particular state is something that other elements using the resource may need to know if it affects their processing, even though they never interact with element A directly. That fact about A is a part of the interface between A and the other elements in A’s environment. In this chapter, we focus only on the direct interactions.
