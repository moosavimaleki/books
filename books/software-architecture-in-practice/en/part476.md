Complex interfaces of elements that are both stateful and active will feature a combination of operations, events, and properties. #### Interface Evolution All software evolves, including interfaces. Software that is encapsulated by an interface is free to evolve without impact to the elements that use this interface as long as the interface itself does not change. An interface, however, is a contract between an element and its actors. Just as a legal contract can be changed only within certain constraints, software interfaces should be changed with care. Three techniques can be used to change an interface: deprecation, versioning, and extension. *  Deprecation. Deprecation means removing an interface. Best practice when deprecating an interface is to give extensive notice to the actors of the element. This warning, in theory, allows the actors time to adjust to the interfaceâ€™s removal. In practice, many actors will not adjust in advance, but rather will discover the deprecation only when the interface is removed. One technique when deprecating an interface is to introduce an error code signifying that this interface is to be deprecated at (specific date) or that this interface has been deprecated.
