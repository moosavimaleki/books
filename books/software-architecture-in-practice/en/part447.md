## 14 Working with Other Quality Attributes Quality is not what happens when what you do matches your intentions. It is what happens when what you do matches your customers’ expectations. —Guaspari [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[13](ch13.xhtml#ch13) each dealt with a particular quality attribute (QA) that is important to software systems. Each of those chapters discussed how its particular QA is defined, gave a general scenario for that QA, and showed how to write specific scenarios to express precise shades of meaning concerning that QA. In addition, each provided a collection of techniques to achieve that QA in an architecture. In short, each chapter presented a kind of portfolio for specifying and designing to achieve a particular QA. However, as you can no doubt infer, those ten chapters only begin to scratch the surface of the various QAs that you might need in a software system you’re working on. This chapter will show how to build the same kind of specification and design approach for a QA not covered in our “A list.”
