*  Modularity violation. Structurally decoupled modules frequently change together. To identify this anti-pattern, search for two or more structurally independent files—that is, files that have no structural dependency on each other—that change together frequently. *  Unhealthy inheritance. A base class depends on its subclasses or a client class depends on both the base class and one or more of its subclasses. To determine unhealthy inheritance instances, search for either of the following two sets of relationships in a DSM: *  In an inheritance hierarchy, a parent depends on its child class. *  In an inheritance hierarchy, a client of the class hierarchy depends on both the parent and one or more of its children. *  Cyclic dependency or clique. A group of files is tightly connected. To identify this anti-pattern, search for sets of files that form a strongly connected graph, where there is a structural dependency path between any two elements of the graph.
