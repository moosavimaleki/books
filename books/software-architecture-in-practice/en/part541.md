The management gateway returns not only the IP address for the newly allocated VM, but also a hostname. The hostname returned after allocating a VM reflects the fact that the IP address has been added to the cloud Domain Name System (DNS). Any VM image can be used to create the new VM instance; that is, the VM image may comprise a simple service or be just one step in the deployment process to create a complex system. The management gateway performs other functions in addition to allocating new VMs. It supports collecting billing information about the VM, and it provides the capability to monitor and destroy the VM. The management gateway is accessed through messages over the Internet to its API. These messages can come from another service, such as a deployment service, or they can be generated from a command-line program on your computer (allowing you to script operations). The management gateway can also be accessed through a web-based application operated by the cloud service provider, although this kind of interactive interface is not efficient for more than the most trivial operations.
