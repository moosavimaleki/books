Figure 12.1 A model of testing For a system to be properly testable, it must be possible to control each component’s inputs (and possibly manipulate its internal state) and then to observe its outputs (and possibly its internal state, either after or on the way to computing the outputs). Frequently, control and observation are accomplished through the use of a test harness, a set of specialized software (or in some cases, hardware) designed to exercise the software under test. Test harnesses come in various forms, and may include capabilities such as a record-and-playback capability for data sent across interfaces, or a simulator for an external environment in which a piece of embedded software is tested, or even distinct software that runs during production (see the sidebar “[Netflix’s Simian Army](ch12.xhtml#side02)”). The test harness can provide assistance in executing the test procedures and recording the output. A test harness and its accompanying infrastructure can be substantial pieces of software in their own right, with their own architecture, stakeholders, and quality attribute requirements.
