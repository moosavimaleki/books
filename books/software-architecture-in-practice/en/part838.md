#### Duties This section summarizes a wide variety of architectsâ€™ duties. Not every architect in every organization will perform every one of these duties on every project. However, competent architects should not be surprised to find themselves engaged in any of the activities listed here. We divide these duties into technical duties ([Table 25.1](ch25.xhtml#ch25tab01)) and nontechnical duties ([Table 25.2](ch25.xhtml#ch25tab02)). One immediate observation you should make is the large number of many nontechnical duties. An obvious implication, for those of you who wish to be architects, is that you must pay adequate attention to the nontechnical aspects of your education and your professional activities.
