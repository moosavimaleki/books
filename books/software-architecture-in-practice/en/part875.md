The qubit operations discussed in [Section 26.2](ch26.xhtml#ch26lev1sec2) lend themselves to a programming style where operations are chained together to perform useful functionality. This will likely follow the same arc as machine languages for classical computers. Machine languages still exist but have become a realm consigned to only a handful of programmers. Most programmers use a wide variety of higher-level languages. We should expect to see the same evolution in programming quantum computers. Efforts at quantum computing language design are under way but remain in a nascent state. Programming languages are only the tip of the iceberg. What about the other topics we have covered in this book? Are there new quality attributes relevant to quantum computers, new architectural patterns, an additional architecture view? Almost certainly. What will a network of quantum computers look like? Will hybrid networks of quantum and classical computers become widespread? All of these are potential areas into which quantum computing will almost certainly evolveâ€”eventually.
