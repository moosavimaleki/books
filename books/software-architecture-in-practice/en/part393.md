Recovering from Attacks Does the system support maintaining an audit trail to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker? Does the system guarantee the property of nonrepudiation, which guarantees that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message? Have you checked the “recover from faults” category of tactics from [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)? ### 11.4 Patterns for Security Two of the more well-known patterns for security are intercepting validator and intrusion prevention system. #### Intercepting Validator This pattern inserts a software element—a wrapper—between the source and the destination of messages. This approach assumes greater importance when the source of the messages is outside the system. The most common responsibility of this pattern is to implement the verify message integrity tactic, but it can also incorporate tactics such as detect intrusion and detect service denial (by comparing messages to known intrusion patterns), or detect message delivery anomalies.
