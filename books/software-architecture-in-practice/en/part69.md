4. Find a commonly accepted definition of system architecture and discuss what it has in common with software architecture. Do the same for enterprise architecture. 5. Find a published example of a software architecture. Which structures are shown? Given its purpose, which structures should have been shown? What analysis does the architecture support? Critique it: What questions do you have that the representation does not answer? 6. Sailing ships have architectures, which means they have “structures” that lend themselves to reasoning about the ship’s performance and other quality attributes. Look up the technical definitions for barque, brig, cutter, frigate, ketch, schooner, and sloop. Propose a useful set of “structures” for distinguishing and reasoning about ship architectures. 7. Aircraft have architectures that can be characterized by how they resolve some major design questions, such as engine location, wing location, landing gear layout, and more. For many decades, most jet aircraft designed for passenger transport have the following characteristics:
