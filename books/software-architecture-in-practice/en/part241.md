![A sample concrete integrability scenario is presented.](graphics/07fig01.jpg) Figure 7.1 Sample integrability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a component marketplace. The stimulus is the new data filtering component becomes available. The artifact is the system. The environment is the development. The response is the new component integrated and deployed. The response measure is 1 month with no more than 1 person-month of effort. ### 7.3 Integrability Tactics The goals for the integrability tactics are to reduce the costs and risks of adding new components, reintegrating changed components, and integrating sets of components together to fulfill evolutionary requirements, as illustrated in [Figure 7.2](ch07.xhtml#ch07fig02). ![The tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the new components arrive. The response is the components are integrated within time, cost, and quality constraints.](graphics/07fig02.jpg) Figure 7.2 Goal of integrability tactics The tactics achieve these goals either by reducing the number of potential dependencies between components or by reducing the expected distance between components. [Figure 7.3](ch07.xhtml#ch07fig03) shows an overview of the integrability tactics.
