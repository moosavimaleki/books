### 3.7 Summary Functional requirements are satisfied by including an appropriate set of responsibilities within the design. Quality attribute requirements are satisfied by the structures and behaviors of the architecture. One challenge in architectural design is that these requirements are often captured poorly, if at all. To capture and express a quality attribute requirement, we recommend the use of a quality attribute scenario. Each scenario consists of six parts: 1.  Source of stimulus 2.  Stimulus 3.  Environment 4.  Artifact 5.  Response 6.  Response measure An architectural tactic is a design decision that affects a quality attribute response. The focus of a tactic is on a single quality attribute response. An architectural pattern describes a particular recurring design problem that arises in specific design contexts and presents a well-proven architectural solution for the problem. Architectural patterns can be seen as “bundles” of tactics. An analyst can understand the decisions made in an architecture through the use of a tactics-based checklist. This lightweight architecture analysis technique can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the architecture in a very short amount of time.
