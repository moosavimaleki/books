A tactics-based analysis can lead to surprising results in a very short time. For example, once I was analyzing a system that managed healthcare data. We had agreed to analyze the quality attribute of security. During the session, I dutifully walked through the security tactics–based questionnaire, asking each question in turn (as you may recall, in these questionnaires each tactic is transformed into a question). For example, I asked, “Does the system support the detection of intrusions?”, “Does the system support the verification of message integrity?”, and so forth. When I got to the question “Does the system support data encryption?”, the architect paused and smiled. Then he (sheepishly) admitted that the system had a requirement that no data could be passed over a network “in the clear”—that is, without encryption. So they XOR’ed all data before sending it over the network. This is a great example of the kind of risk that a tactics-based questionnaire can uncover, very quickly and inexpensively. Yes, they had met the requirement in a strict sense—they were not sending any data in the clear. But the encryption algorithm that they chose could be cracked by a high school student with modest abilities!
