*  Specialized interfaces. Having specialized testing interfaces allows you to control or capture variable values for a component either through the application of a test harness or through normal execution. Examples of specialized test routines, some of which might otherwise not be available except for testing purposes, include these: A set and get method for important variables, modes, or attributes A report method that returns the full state of the object A reset method to set the internal state (e.g., all the attributes of a class) to a specified internal state A method to turn on verbose output, various levels of event logging, performance instrumentation, or resource monitoring Specialized testing interfaces and methods should be clearly identified or kept separate from the access methods and interfaces for required functionality, so that they can be removed if needed. Note, however, that in performance-critical and some safety-critical systems, it is problematic to field different code than that which was tested. If you remove the test code, how will you know the code released has the same behavior, particularly the same timing behavior, as the code you tested? Thus this strategy is more effective for other kinds of systems.
