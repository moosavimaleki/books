The map-reduce pattern has three parts: *  First is a specialized infrastructure that takes care of allocating software to the hardware nodes in a massively parallel computing environment and handles sorting the data as needed. A node may be a virtual machine, a standalone processor, or a core in a multi-core chip. *  Second and third are two programmer-coded functions called, predictably enough, map and reduce.
