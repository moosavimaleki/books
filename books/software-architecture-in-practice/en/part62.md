5.  The architecture should lend itself to incremental implementation, to avoid having to integrate everything at once (which almost never works) as well as to discover problems early. One way to do this is via the creation of a “skeletal” system in which the communication paths are exercised but which at first has minimal functionality. This skeletal system can be used to “grow” the system incrementally, refactoring as necessary. Our structural rules of thumb are as follows: 1.  The architecture should feature well-defined modules whose functional responsibilities are assigned on the principles of information hiding and separation of concerns. The information-hiding modules should encapsulate things likely to change, thereby insulating the software from the effects of those changes. Each module should have a well-defined interface that encapsulates or “hides” the changeable aspects from other software that uses its facilities. These interfaces should allow their respective development teams to work largely independently of each other.
