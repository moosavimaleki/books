![A figure shows a cloud data center. Few rows of large supercomputers are shown.](graphics/17fig01.jpg) Figure 17.1 A cloud data center When you access a cloud via a public cloud provider, you are actually accessing data centers scattered around the globe. The cloud provider organizes its data centers into regions. A cloud region is both a logical and a physical construct. Since the services you develop and deploy to the cloud are accessed over the Internet, cloud regions can help you be sure that the service is physically close to its users, thereby reducing the network delay to access the service. Also, some regulatory constraints, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), may restrict the transmission of certain types of data across national borders, so cloud regions help cloud providers comply with these regulations. A cloud region has many data centers that are physically distributed and have different sources for electrical power and Internet connectivity. The data centers within a region are grouped into availability zones, such that the probability of all data centers in two different availability zones failing at the same time is extremely low.
