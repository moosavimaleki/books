#### Observer The observer pattern is a way to link some functionality with one or more views. This pattern has a subject—the entity being observed—and one or more observers of that subject. Observers need to register themselves with the subject; then, when the state of the subject changes, the observers are notified. This pattern is often used to implement MVC (and its variants)—for example, as a way to notify the various views of changes to the model. Benefits: *  This pattern separates some underlying functionality from the concern of how, and how many times, this functionality is presented. *  The observer pattern makes it easy to change the bindings between the subject and the observers at runtime. Tradeoffs: *  The observer pattern is overkill if multiple views of the subject are not required. *  The observer pattern requires that all observers register and de-register with the subject. If observers neglect to de-register, then their memory is never freed, which effectively results in a memory leak. In addition, this can negatively affect performance, since obsolete observers will continue to be invoked.
