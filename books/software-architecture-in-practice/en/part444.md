Benefits: *  The obvious benefit of this pattern is that you delegate the complicated process of implementing undo, and figuring out what state to preserve, to the class that is actually creating and managing that state. In consequence, the originatorâ€™s abstraction is preserved and the rest of the system does not need to know the details. Tradeoffs: *  Depending on the nature of the state being preserved, the memento can consume arbitrarily large amounts of memory, which can affect performance. In a very large document, try cutting and pasting many large sections, and then undoing all of that. This is likely to result in your text processor noticeably slowing down. *  In some programming languages, it is difficult to enforce the memento as an opaque abstraction. ### 13.5 For Further Reading Claire Marie Karat has investigated the relation between usability and business advantage [[Karat 94](ref01.xhtml#ref_134)]. Jakob Nielsen has also written extensively on this topic, including a calculation of the ROI of usability [[Nielsen 08](ref01.xhtml#ref_190)].
