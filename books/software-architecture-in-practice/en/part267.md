Change is so prevalent in the life of software systems that special names have been given to specific flavors of modifiability. Some of the common ones are highlighted here: *  Scalability is about accommodating more of something. In terms of performance, scalability means adding more resources. Two kinds of performance scalability are horizontal scalability and vertical scalability. Horizontal scalability (scaling out) refers to adding more resources to logical units, such as adding another server to a cluster of servers. Vertical scalability (scaling-up) refers to adding more resources to a physical unit, such as adding more memory to a single computer. The problem that arises with either type of scaling is how to effectively utilize the additional resources. Being effective means that the additional resources result in a measurable improvement of some system quality, did not require undue effort to add, and did not unduly disrupt operations. In cloud-based environments, horizontal scalability is called elasticity. Elasticity is a property that enables a customer to add or remove virtual machines from the resource pool (see [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17) for further discussion of such environments).
