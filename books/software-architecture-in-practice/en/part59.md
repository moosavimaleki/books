#### Architectural Patterns In some cases, architectural elements are composed in ways that solve particular problems. These compositions have been found to be useful over time and over many different domains, so they have been documented and disseminated. These compositions of architectural elements, which provide packaged strategies for solving some of the problems facing a system, are called patterns. Architectural patterns are discussed in detail in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02) of this book. ### 1.3 What Makes a “Good” Architecture? There is no such thing as an inherently good or bad architecture. Architectures are either more or less fit for some purpose. A three-tier layered service-oriented architecture may be just the ticket for a large enterprise’s web-based B2B system but completely wrong for an avionics application. An architecture carefully crafted to achieve high modifiability does not make sense for a throw-away prototype (and vice versa!). One of the messages of this book is that architectures can, in fact, be evaluated—one of the great benefits of paying attention to them—but such evaluation only makes sense in the context of specific stated goals.
