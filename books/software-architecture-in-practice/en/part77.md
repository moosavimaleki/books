Deciding when changes are essential, determining which change paths have the least risk, assessing the consequences of proposed changes, and arbitrating sequences and priorities for requested changes all require broad insight into the relationships, performance, and behaviors of system software elements. These tasks are all part of the job description for an architect. Reasoning about the architecture and analyzing the architecture can provide the insights necessary to make decisions about anticipated changes. If you do not take this step, and if you do not pay attention to maintaining the conceptual integrity of your architecture, then you will almost certainly accumulate architecture debt. We deal with this subject in [Chapter 23](ch23.xhtml#ch23). ### 2.3 Predicting System Qualities This point follows from the previous two: Architecture not only imbues systems with qualities, but does so in a predictable way. This may seem obvious, but it need not be the case. Then designing an architecture would consist of making a series of pretty much random design decisions, building the system, testing for quality attributes, and hoping for the best.
