You may be wondering what constitutes “too many requests” and “reasonable response time.” We’ll come back to these questions later in this chapter when we discuss autoscaling. For now, let’s focus on how a load balancer works. In [Figure 17.4](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig04), each request is sent to a load balancer. For the purposes of our discussion, suppose the load balancer sends the first request to instance 1, the second request to instance 2, the third request back to instance 1, and so forth. This sends half of the requests to each instance, balancing the load between the two instances—hence the name. Some observations about this simple example of a load balancer: *  The algorithm we provided—alternate the messages between the two instances—is called “round-robin.” This algorithm balances the load uniformly across the service instances only if every request consumes roughly the same resources in its response. Other algorithms for distributing the messages exist for cases where the resource consumption needed to process requests varies.
