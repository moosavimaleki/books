*  Uniform access principle. Avoid leaking implementation details through the interface. A resource should be accessible to its actors in the same way regardless of how they are implemented. An actor should be unaware, for example, whether a value is returned from a cache, from a computation, or from a fresh fetch of the value from some external source. *  Don’t repeat yourself principle. Interfaces should offer a set of composable primitives as opposed to many redundant ways to achieve the same goal. Consistency is an important aspect of designing clear interfaces. As an architect, you should establish and follow conventions on how resources are named, how API parameters are ordered, and how errors should be handled. Of course, not all interfaces are under the control of the architect, but insofar as possible the design of interfaces should be consistent throughout all elements of the same architecture. Developers will also appreciate it if interfaces follow the conventions of the underlying platform or the programming language idioms they expect. More than winning developers’ goodwill, however, consistency will help minimize the number of development errors based on misunderstanding.
