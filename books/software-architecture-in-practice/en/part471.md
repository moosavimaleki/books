3.  An element can interact with more than one actor through the same interface. For example, web servers often restrict the number of HTTP connections that can be open simultaneously. ### 15.1 Interface Concepts In this section, we discuss the concepts of multiple interfaces, resources, operations, properties, and events, as well as the evolution of interfaces. #### Multiple Interfaces It is possible to split a single interface into multiple interfaces. Each of these has a related logical purpose, and serves a different class of actors. Multiple interfaces provide a kind of separation of concerns. A specific class of actor might require only a subset of the functionality available; this functionality can be provided by one of the interfaces. Conversely, the provider of an element may want to grant actors different access rights, such as read or write, or to implement a security policy. Multiple interfaces support different levels of access. For example, an element might expose its functionality through its main interface and give access to debugging or performance monitoring data or administrative functions via separate interfaces. There may be public read-only interfaces for anonymous actors and private interfaces that allow authenticated and authorized actors to modify the state of an element.
