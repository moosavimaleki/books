![An illustration shows the preliminary documentation.](graphics/20fig04.jpg) Figure 20.4 Example preliminary documentation A diagram shows the example of preliminary documentation. A lightly shaded rectangular block represents the component boundary. A light blue shaded rectangular block represents an element boundary. A right arrow represents the data flow. The data stream element boundary is shown on the left. The master dataset element boundary and pre-computing element boundary are enclosed inside a batch component boundary at the top. The real-time viewer element boundary is enclosed inside the speed component boundary at the bottom. The query and reporting elementary boundary is shown on the right. The data flow from the data stream to the master dataset, pre-computing, real-time viewers, and finally reaches the query and reporting. The diagram is complemented by a table that describes the elementâ€™s responsibilities. [Table 20.1](ch20.xhtml#ch20tab01) serves this purpose for some of the elements identified in [Figure 20.4](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig04). Table 20.1 Elements and Responsibilities
