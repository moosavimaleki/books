#### System Quality Attributes Physical systems, such as aircraft and automobiles and kitchen appliances, that rely on software embedded within them are designed to meet a whole litany of QAs: weight, size, electric consumption, power output, pollution output, weather resistance, battery life, and on and on. Often the software architecture can have a profound effect on the system’s QAs. For example, software that makes inefficient use of computing resources might require additional memory, a faster processor, a bigger battery, or even an additional processor (we dealt with the topic of energy efficiency as a QA in [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#ch06)). Additional processors will add to a system’s power consumption, of course, but also to its weight, its physical profile, and expense. Conversely, the architecture or implementation of a system can enable or preclude software from meeting its QA requirements. For example: 1.  The performance of a piece of software is fundamentally constrained by the performance of the processor that runs it. No matter how well you design the software, you just can’t run the latest whole-earth weather forecasting models on Grandpa’s laptop and expect to know if it’s going to rain tomorrow.
