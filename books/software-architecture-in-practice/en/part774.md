*  End users do not need to see the architecture, which is, after all, largely invisible to them. Nevertheless, they can often gain useful insights into the system, what it does, and how they can use it effectively by examining the architecture. If end users or their representatives review your architecture, you may be able to uncover design discrepancies that would otherwise have gone unnoticed until deployment. To serve this purpose, an end user is likely to be interested in the following views: C&C views. Views emphasizing flow of control and transformation of data, to see how inputs are transformed into outputs; analysis results dealing with properties of interest, such as performance or reliability. Allocation views. A deployment view to understand how functionality is allocated to the platforms with which the users interact. Other. Context diagrams. *  C&C views.
