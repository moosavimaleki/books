As in canary testing, DNS servers and discovery-service configurations are set to send client requests to different versions. In A/B testing, the different versions are monitored to see which one provides the best response from a business perspective. Benefits: *  A/B testing allows marketing and product development teams to run experiments on, and collect data from, real users. *  A/B testing can allow for targeting of users based on an arbitrary set of characteristics. Tradeoffs: *  A/B testing requires the implementation of alternatives, one of which will be discarded. *  Different classes of users, and their characteristics, need to be identified up front. ### 5.7 For Further Reading Much of the material in this chapter is adapted from Deployment and Operations for Software Engineers by Len Bass and John Klein [[Bass 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_17)] and from [[Kazman 20b](ref01.xhtml#ref_145)]. A general discussion of deployability and architecture in the context of DevOps can be found in [[Bass 15](ref01.xhtml#ref_16)].
