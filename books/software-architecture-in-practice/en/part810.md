Think of the project manager as primarily responsible for the external-facing aspects of the project and the software architect as responsible for the internal technical aspects of the project. The external view needs to accurately reflect the internal situation, and the internal activities need to accurately reflect the expectations of the external stakeholders. That is, the project manager should know, and reflect to upper management, the progress and the risks within the project, whereas the software architect should know, and reflect to developers, external stakeholder concerns. The relationship between the project manager and the software architect can have a large impact on the success of a project. They should have a good working relationship and be mindful of the roles they are filling and the boundaries of those roles. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) lists a number of knowledge areas for project managers. These are the areas for which the project manager will likely turn to the architect for input. [Table 24.1](ch24.xhtml#ch24tab01) identifies the knowledge area described by the PMBOK and the software architectâ€™s role in that area.
