Table 4.1 System Availability Requirements Availability Downtime/90 Days Downtime/Year 99.0% 21 hr, 36 min 3 days, 15.6 hr 99.9% 2 hr, 10 min 8 hr, 0 min, 46 sec 99.99% 12 min, 58 sec 52 min, 34 sec 99.999% 1 min, 18 sec 5 min, 15 sec 99.9999% 8 sec 32 sec ### 4.1 Availability General Scenario We can now describe the individual portions of an availability general scenario as summarized in [Table 4.2](ch04.xhtml#ch04tab02). Table 4.2 Availability General Scenario Portion of Scenario Description Possible Values Source This specifies where the fault comes from. Internal/external: people, hardware, software, physical infrastructure, physical environment Stimulus The stimulus to an availability scenario is a fault. Fault: omission, crash, incorrect timing, incorrect response Artifact This specifies which portions of the system are responsible for and affected by the fault. Processors, communication channels, storage, processes, affected artifacts in the system’s environment Environment We may be interested in not only how a system behaves in its “normal” environment, but also how it behaves in situations such as when it is already recovering from a fault.
