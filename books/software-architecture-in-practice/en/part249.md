The tailor interface tactic allows functionality that is needed by many services to be added or hidden based on context and managed independently. It also enables services with syntactic differences to interoperate without modification to either service. This tactic is typically applied during integration; however, designing an architecture so that it facilitates interface tailoring can support integrability. Interface tailoring is commonly used to resolve syntactic and data semantic distance during integration. It can also be applied to resolve some forms of behavioral semantic distance, though it can be more complex to do (e.g., maintaining a complex state to accommodate protocol differences) and is perhaps more accurately categorized as introducing an intermediary. ##### Configure Behavior The tactic of configuring behavior is used by software components that are implemented to be configurable in prescribed ways that allow them to more easily interact with a range of components. The behavior of a component can be configured during the build phase (recompile with a different flag), during system initialization (read a configuration file or fetch data from a database), or during runtime (specify a protocol version as part of your requests). A simple example is configuring a component to support different versions of a standard on its interfaces. Ensuring that multiple options are available increases the chances that the assumptions of S and a future C will match.
