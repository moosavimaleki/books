### 14.1 Other Kinds of Quality Attributes The quality attributes covered so far in [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02) of this book all have something in common: They deal with either the system in operation, or the development project that creates and fields the system. Put another way, to measure one of those QAs, either you measure the system while it is running (availability, energy efficiency, performance, security, safety, usability), or you measure the people doing something to the system while it is not (modifiability, deployability, integrability, testability). While these certainly give you an “A list” of important QAs, there are other qualities that could be equally useful. #### Quality Attributes of the Architecture Another category of QAs focuses on measuring the architecture itself. Here are three examples: *  Buildability. This QA measures how well the architecture lends itself to rapid and efficient development. It is measured by the cost (typically in money or time) that it takes to turn the architecture into a working product that meets all of its requirements. In that sense, it resembles the other QAs that measure a development project, but it differs in that the knowledge targeted by the measurement relates to the architecture itself.
