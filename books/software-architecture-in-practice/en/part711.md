These cliffhangers certainly stand out in our memory. There was no architecture documented. But it was okay. It wasn’t the right architecture. But it was okay. There was no architect. But it was okay. The client really wanted to effect a team reorganization. In every instance, we reacted as reasonably as we could, and each time it was okay. Why? Why, time after time, does it turn out okay? I think there are three reasons. First, the people who commission the architecture evaluation really want it to succeed. The architect, developers, and stakeholders assembled at the client’s behest also want it to succeed. As a group, they help keep the exercise marching toward the goal of architectural insight. Second, we are always honest. If we feel that the exercise is derailing, we call a timeout and confer among ourselves, and usually confer with the client. While a small amount of bravado can come in handy during an exercise, we never, ever try to bluff our way through an evaluation. Participants can detect that false note instinctively, and the evaluation team must never lose the respect of the other participants.
