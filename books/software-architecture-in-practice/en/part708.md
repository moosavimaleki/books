I led the team interviewing the junior designers. We had never gotten a completely satisfactory architecture presentation from the architect. Discrepancies in the documentation were met with a breezy “Oh, well, that’s not how it really works.” So I decided to start over with ATAM step 3. We asked the half dozen or so designers what their view of the architecture was. “Could you draw it?” I asked them. They looked at each other nervously, but one said, “I think I can draw part of it.” He took to the whiteboard and drew a very reasonable component-and-connector view. Someone else volunteered to draw a process view. A third person drew the architecture for an important offline part of the system. Others jumped in to assist. As we looked around the room, everyone was busy transcribing the whiteboard pictures. None of the pictures corresponded to anything we had seen in the documentation so far. “Are these diagrams documented anywhere?” I asked. One of the designers looked up from his busy scribbling for a moment to grin. “They are now,” he said.
