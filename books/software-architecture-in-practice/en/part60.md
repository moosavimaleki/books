Nevertheless, some rules of thumb should be followed when designing most architectures. Failure to apply any of these guidelines does not automatically mean that the architecture will be fatally flawed, but it should at least serve as a warning sign that should be investigated. These rules can be applied proactively for greenfield development, to help build the system “right.” Or they can be applied as analysis heuristics, to understand the potential problem areas in existing systems and to guide the direction of its evolution. We divide our observations into two clusters: process recommendations and product (or structural) recommendations. Our process recommendations are as follows: 1.  A software (or system) architecture should be the product of a single architect or a small group of architects with an identified technical leader. This approach is important to give the architecture its conceptual integrity and technical consistency. This recommendation holds for agile and open source projects as well as “traditional” ones. There should be a strong connection between the architects and the development team, to avoid “ivory tower,” impractical designs.
