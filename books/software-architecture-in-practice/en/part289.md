*  In some cases, a component cannot be sure how long it will take to receive a published message. In general, system performance and resource management are more difficult to reason about in publish-subscribe systems. *  Use of this pattern can negatively impact the determinism produced by synchronous systems. The order in which methods are invoked, as a result of an event, can vary in some implementations. *  Use of the publish-subscribe pattern can negatively impact testability. Seemingly small changes in the event bus—such as a change in which components are associated with which events—can have a wide impact on system behavior and quality of service. *  Some publish-subscribe implementations limit the mechanisms available to flexibly implement security (integrity). Since publishers do not know the identity of their subscribers, and vice versa, end-to-end encryption is limited. Messages from a publisher to the event bus can be uniquely encrypted, and messages from the event bus to a subscriber can be uniquely encrypted; however, any end-to-end encrypted communication requires all publishers and subscribers involved to share the same key.
