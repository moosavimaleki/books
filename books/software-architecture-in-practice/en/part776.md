Variability guides. *  Future architects are the most avid readers of architecture documentation, with a vested interest in everything. You, after a period of time, or your replacement (when you get promoted and assigned to a more complex project) will want to know all the key design decisions and why they were made. Future architects are interested in it all, but they will be especially keen to have access to comprehensive and candid rationale and design information. And, remember, that future architect might be you! Do not expect to remember all of these minute design decisions that youâ€™re making now. Remember, architecture documentation is a love letter you write to your future self.
