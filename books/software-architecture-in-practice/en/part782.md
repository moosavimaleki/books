### 22.10 Summary Writing architectural documentation is much like other types of writing. The golden rule is: Know your reader. You must understand the uses to which the writing will be put and the audience for the writing. Architectural documentation serves as a means for communication among various stakeholders: up the management chain, down into the developers, and across to peers. An architecture is a complicated artifact, best expressed by focusing on particular perspectives, called views, which depend on the message to be communicated. You must choose the views to document and choose the notation to document these views. This may involve combining various views that have a large overlap. You must not only document the structure of the architecture but also the behavior. In addition, you should document the relations among the views in your documentation, the patterns you use, the systemâ€™s context, any variability mechanisms built into the architecture, and the rationale for your major design decisions.
