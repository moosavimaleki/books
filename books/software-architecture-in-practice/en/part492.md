##### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) JSON structures data as nested name/value pairs and array data types. The JSON notation grew out of the JavaScript language and was first standardized in 2013; today, however, it is independent of any programming language. Like XML, JSON is a textual representation featuring its own schema language. Compared to XML, however, JSON is significantly less verbose, as field names occur only once. Using a name/value representation instead of start and end tags, JSON documents can be parsed as they are read. JSON data types are derived from JavaScript data types, and resemble those of any modern programming language. This makes JSON serialization and deserialization much more efficient than XML. The notation’s original use case was to send JavaScript objects between a browser and web server—for example, to transfer a lightweight data representation to be rendered as HTML in the browser, as opposed to performing the rendering on the server side and having to download more verbose views represented using HTML.
