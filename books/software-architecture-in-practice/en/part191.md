![A sample concrete deployability scenario is presented.](graphics/05fig01.jpg) Figure 5.1 Sample concrete deployability scenario The general quality attribute scenario is shown. The source is a component marketplace. The stimulus is a new release of the authentication/authorization service is made available and the product owner decides to incorporate it. The artifact is the authentication/authorization service. The environment is production. The response is the new service is tested in-house and deployed to production servers. The response measure is within 40 hours and no more than 120 person-hours of effort; no defects introduced; no SLA violated. ### 5.4 Tactics for Deployability A deployment is catalyzed by the release of a new software or hardware element. The deployment is successful if these new elements are deployed within acceptable time, cost, and quality constraints. We illustrate this relationship—and hence the goal of deployability tactics—in [Figure 5.2](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02). ![The tactics to control response diagram is presented. The stimulus is the new elements arrive. The response is the elements deployed within time, cost, and quality constraints.](graphics/05fig02.jpg)
