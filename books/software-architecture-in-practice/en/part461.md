If you are creating your own model, your set of scenarios will inform your investigation. Its parameters can be derived from the stimuli (and its sources), the responses (and their measures), the artifacts (and their properties), and the environment (and its characteristics). #### Assemble Design Approaches for the New Quality Attribute The process of generating a set of mechanisms based on a model includes the following steps: *  Enumerate the model’s parameters. *  For each parameter, enumerate the architectural characteristics (and the mechanisms to achieve those characteristics) that can affect this parameter. You can do this by: Revisiting a body of mechanisms you’re familiar with and asking yourself how each one affects the QA parameter. Searching for designs that have successfully dealt with this QA. You can search on the name you’ve given the QA itself, but you can also search for the terms you chose when you refined the QA into subattributes.
