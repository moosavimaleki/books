Figure 10.2 Goal of safety tactics A logical precondition to avoid or detect entry into an unsafe state is the ability to recognize what constitutes an unsafe state. The following tactics assume that capability, which means that you should perform your own hazard analysis or FTA once you have your architecture in hand. Your design decisions may themselves have introduced new safety vulnerabilities not accounted for during requirements analysis. You will note a substantial overlap between the tactics presented here and those presented in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) on availability. This overlap occurs because availability problems may often lead to safety problems, and because many of the design solutions for repairing these problems are shared between the qualities. [Figure 10.3](ch10.xhtml#ch10fig03) summarizes the architectural tactics to achieve safety. ![A flowchart of the safety tactics.](graphics/10fig03.jpg) Figure 10.3 Safety tactics The safety tactics is depicted as a chart. The safety tactics is divided into unsafe state avoidance, unsafe state detection, containment, and recovery. The unsafe state avoidance lists the following: substitution and predictive model. The unsafe state detection lists the following: sanity check, comparison, timeout, condition monitoring, and time stamp. The containment is divided into redundancy, limit consequences, and barrier. Redundancy lists the following: replication, analytic redundancy, and functional redundancy. The limit consequences list the following: masking, abort, and degradation. The barrier lists the following: firewall and interlock. The recovery lists the following: rollback, reconfiguration, and repair state.
