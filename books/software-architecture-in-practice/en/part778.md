#### Online Documentation, Hypertext, and Wikis Documentation for a system can be structured as linked web pages. Web-oriented documents typically consist of short pages (created to fit on one screen) with a deeper structure. One page usually provides some overview information and has links to more detailed information. Using tools such as wikis, it’s possible to create a shared document to which many stakeholders can contribute. The hosting organization needs to decide what permissions it wants to give to various stakeholders; the tool used has to support the chosen permissions policy. In the case of architecture documentation, we want selected stakeholders to comment on and add clarifying information to the architecture, but we would want only selected team personnel to be able to actually change it. #### Follow a Release Strategy Your project’s development plan should specify the process for keeping the important documentation, including the architecture documentation, current. Document artifacts should be subject to version control, as with any other important project artifact. The architect should plan to issue releases of the documentation to support major project milestones, which usually means far enough ahead of the milestone to give developers time to put the architecture to work. For example, revised documentation could be provided to the development team at the end of each iteration or sprint or with each incremental release.
