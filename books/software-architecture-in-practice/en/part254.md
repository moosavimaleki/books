Does the system provide a resource manager that governs access to computing resources? ### 7.5 Patterns The first three patterns are all centered on the tailor interface tactic, and are described here as a group: *  Wrappers. A wrapper is a form of encapsulation whereby some component is encased within an alternative abstraction. A wrapper is the only element allowed to use that component; every other piece of software uses the component’s services by going through the wrapper. The wrapper transforms the data or control information for the component it wraps. For example, a component may expect input using Imperial measures but find itself in a system in which all of the other components produce metric measures. Wrappers can: Translate an element of a component interface into an alternative element Hide an element of a component interface Preserve an element of a component’s base interface without change *  Translate an element of a component interface into an alternative element
