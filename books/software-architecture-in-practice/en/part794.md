This project, in fact, suffers from high architecture debt. The architects confirm this. They report that almost every change in the project is costly and complex, and predicting when new features will be ready or when bugs will be fixed is challenging. While this kind of qualitative analysis can, by itself, be of value to an architect or analyst, we can do better: We can actually quantify the costs and impact of the debt that our code base is already carrying, and we can do this fully automatically. To do so, we use the concept of “hotspots”—areas of the architecture with design flaws, sometimes called architecture anti-patterns or architecture flaws. ### 23.2 Discovering Hotspots If you suspect that your code base has architecture debt—perhaps bug rates are going up and feature velocity is going down—you need to identify the specific files and their flawed relationships that are creating that debt.
