As when using XML and JSON, the interacting elements may be written in different languages. Each element then uses the Protocol Buffer compiler specific to its language. Although Protocol Buffers can be used for any data-structuring purpose, they are mostly employed as part of the gRPC protocol. Protocol Buffers are specified using an interface description language. Since they are compiled by language-specific compilers, the specification is necessary to ensure correct behavior of the interface. It also acts as documentation for the interfaces. Placing the interface specification in a database allows for searching it to see how values propagate through the various elements. #### Error Handling When designing an interface, architects naturally concentrate on how it is supposed to be used in the nominal case, when everything works according to plan. The real world, of course, is far from the nominal case, and a well-designed system must know how to take appropriate action in the face of undesired circumstances. What happens when an operation is called with invalid parameters? What happens when a resource requires more memory than is available? What happens when a call to an operation never returns, because it has failed? What happens when the interface is supposed to trigger a notification event based on the value of a sensor, but the sensor isnâ€™t responding or is responding with gibberish?
