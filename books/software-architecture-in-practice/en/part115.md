*  Artifact. The stimulus arrives at some target. This is often captured as just the system or project itself, but it’s helpful to be more precise if possible. The artifact may be a collection of systems, the whole system, or one or more pieces of the system. A failure or a change request may affect just a small portion of the system. A failure in a data store may be treated differently than a failure in the metadata store. Modifications to the user interface may have faster response times than modifications to the middleware. To summarize, we capture quality attribute requirements as six-part scenarios. While it is common to omit one or more of these six parts, particularly in the early stages of thinking about quality attributes, knowing that all of the parts are there forces the architect to consider whether each part is relevant. We have created a general scenario for each of the quality attributes presented in [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[13](ch13.xhtml#ch13) to facilitate brainstorming and elicitation of concrete scenarios. We distinguish general quality attribute scenarios—general scenarios—which are system independent and can pertain to any system, from concrete quality attribute scenarios—concrete scenarios—which are specific to the particular system under consideration.
