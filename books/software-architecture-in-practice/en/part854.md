### 25.4 Summary When we think of software architects, we usually first think of the technical work that they produce. But, in the same way that an architecture is much more than a technical “blueprint” for a system, an architect is much more than a designer of an architecture. This has led us to try to understand, in a more holistic way, what an architect and an architecture-centric organization must do to succeed. An architect must carry out the duties, hone the skills, and continuously acquire the knowledge necessary to be successful. The key to becoming a good and then a better architect is continuous learning, mentoring, and being mentored. ### 25.5 For Further Reading Questions to probe an organization’s competence can be found in the Technical Note, “Models for Evaluating and Improving Architecture Competence,” [sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/08tr006.cfm](http://sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/08tr006.cfm). The Open Group has a certification program for qualifying the skills, knowledge, and experience of IT, business, and enterprise architects, which is related to measuring and certifying an individual architect’s competence.
