In addition to creating and destroying VMs based on utilization metrics, you can set rules to provide a minimum or maximum number of VMs or to create VMs based on a time schedule. During a typical week, for example, load may be heavier during work hours; based on this knowledge, you can allocate more VMs before the beginning of a workday and remove some after the workday is over. These scheduled allocations should be based on historical data about the pattern of usage of your services. When the autoscaler removes an instance, it cannot just shut down the VM. First, it must notify the load balancer to stop sending requests to the service instance. Next, because the instance may be in the process of servicing a request, the autoscaler must notify the instance that it should terminate its activities and shut down, after which it can be destroyed. This process is called “draining” the instance. As a service developer, you are responsible for implementing the appropriate interface to receive instructions to terminate and drain an instance of your service.
