[3](ch04.xhtml#ch04fn3). A protection group is a group of processing nodes in which one or more nodes are “active,” with the remaining nodes serving as redundant spares. *  Passive redundancy (warm spare). For stateful components, this refers to a configuration in which only the active members of the protection group process input traffic. One of their duties is to provide the redundant spare(s) with periodic state updates. Because the state maintained by the redundant spares is only loosely coupled with that of the active node(s) in the protection group (with the looseness of the coupling being a function of the period of the state updates), the redundant nodes are referred to as warm spares. Passive redundancy provides a solution that achieves a balance between the more highly available but more compute-intensive (and expensive) active redundancy pattern and the less available but significantly less complex cold spare pattern (which is also significantly cheaper).
