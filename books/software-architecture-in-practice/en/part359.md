The repair state tactic repairs an erroneous state—effectively increasing the set of states that a component can handle competently (i.e., without failure)—and then continues execution. For example, a vehicle’s lane keep assist feature will monitor whether a driver is staying within their lane and actively return the vehicle to a position between the lines—a safe state—if it drifts out. This tactic is inappropriate as a means of recovery from unanticipated faults. Reconfiguration attempts to recover from component failures by remapping the logical architecture onto the (potentially limited) resources left functioning. Ideally, this remapping allows full functionality to be maintained. When this is not possible, the system may be able to maintain partial functionality in combination with the degradation tactic. ### 10.3 Tactics-Based Questionnaire for Safety Based on the tactics described in [Section 10.2](ch10.xhtml#ch10lev1sec2), we can create a set of tactics-inspired questions, as presented in [Table 10.2](ch10.xhtml#ch10tab02). To gain an overview of the architectural choices made to support safety, the analyst asks each question and records the answers in the table. The answers to these questions can then be made the focus of further activities: investigation of documentation, analysis of code or other artifacts, reverse engineering of code, and so forth.
