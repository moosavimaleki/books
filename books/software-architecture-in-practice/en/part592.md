### 18.5 Life Cycle The life cycle of mobile systems tends to feature some idiosyncrasies that an architect needs to take into account, and these differ from the choices made for traditional (nonmobile) systems. We’ll dive right in. #### The Architect’s Concerns The architect must be concerned with the hardware choices, testing, deploying updates, and logging. We elaborate on these concerns in the next four subsections. ##### Hardware First For many mobile systems, the hardware is chosen before the software is designed. Consequently, the software architecture must live with the constraints imposed by the chosen hardware. The main stakeholders in early hardware choices are management, sales, and regulators. Their concerns typically focus on ways to reduce risks rather than ways to promote quality attributes. The best approach for a software architect is to actively drive these early discussions, emphasizing the tradeoffs involved, instead of passively awaiting their outcomes. ##### Testing
