*  Blocked time and resource contention. A computation can be blocked because of contention for some needed resource, because the resource is unavailable, or because the computation depends on the result of other computations that are not yet available: Contention for resources. Many resources can be used by only a single client at a time. As a consequence, other clients must wait for access to those resources. [Figure 9.2](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig02) shows events arriving at the system. These events may be in a single stream or in multiple streams. Multiple streams vying for the same resource or different events in the same stream vying for the same resource contribute to latency. The more contention for a resource that occurs, the more latency grows. Availability of resources. Even in the absence of contention, computation cannot proceed if a resource is unavailable. Unavailability may be caused by the resource being offline or by failure of the component for any reason.
