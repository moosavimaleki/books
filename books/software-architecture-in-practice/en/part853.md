Your mentor doesn’t have to be a colleague. You can also join professional societies where you can establish mentor relationships with other members. There are meetups. There are professional social networks. Don’t limit yourself to just your organization. #### Mentor Others You should also be willing to mentor others as a way of giving back or paying forward the kindnesses that have enriched your career. But there is a selfish reason to mentor as well: We find that teaching a concept is the litmus test of whether we deeply understand that concept. If we can’t teach it, it’s likely we don’t really understand it—so that can be part of your goal in teaching and mentoring others in the profession. Good teachers almost always report their delight in how much they learn from their students, and how much their students’ probing questions and surprising insights add to the teachers’ deeper understanding of the subject.
