Once we discovered halfway through an ATAM exercise that the architecture we had prepared to evaluate was being jettisoned in favor of a new one that no one had bothered to mention. During step 6 of phase 1, the architect responded to a problem raised by a scenario by casually mentioning that “the new architecture” would not suffer from that deficiency. Everyone in the room, stakeholders and evaluators alike, looked at each other in the puzzled silence that followed. “What new architecture?” I asked blankly, and out it came. The developing organization (a contractor for the U.S. military, which had commissioned the evaluation) had prepared a new architecture for the system to handle the more stringent requirements they knew were coming in the future. We called a timeout, conferred with the architect and the client, and decided to continue the exercise using the new architecture as the subject instead of the old. We backed up to step 3 (the architecture presentation), but everything else on the table—business goals, utility tree, scenarios—remained completely valid. The evaluation proceeded as before, and at the conclusion of the exercise, our military client was extremely pleased at the knowledge gained.
