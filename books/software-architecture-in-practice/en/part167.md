Of course, other versions of this pattern that employ 5 or 19 or 53 redundant components are also possible. However, in most cases, 3 components are sufficient to ensure a reliable result. Benefits: TMR is simple to understand and to implement. It is blissfully independent of what might be causing disparate results, and is only concerned about making a reasonable choice so that the system can continue to function. Tradeoffs: There is a tradeoff between increasing the level of replication, which raises the cost, and the resulting availability. In systems employing TMR, the statistical likelihood of two or more components failing is vanishingly small, and three components represents a sweet spot between availability and cost. *  TMR is simple to understand and to implement.
