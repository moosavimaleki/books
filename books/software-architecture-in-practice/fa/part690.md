*  During Phases 1 and 2, collectively known as “Evaluation,” everyone gets down to the business of analysis. By now, the evaluation team will have studied the architecture documentation and will have a good idea of what the system is about, the major architectural approaches taken, and the quality attributes that are of paramount importance. During phase 1, the evaluation team meets with the project decision makers to begin information gathering and analysis. In phase 2, the architecture’s stakeholders add their input to the proceedings and analysis continues. *  In Phase 3, “Follow-up,” the evaluation team produces and delivers its final report. This report—which may be a formal document or simply a set of slides—is first circulated to key stakeholders to ensure that it contains no errors of understanding. After this review is complete, it is delivered to the client. [Table 21.2](ch21.xhtml#ch21tab02) shows the four phases of the ATAM, who participates in each phase, and the typical cumulative time spent on the activity—possibly in several segments.
