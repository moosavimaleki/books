[Figure 16.1](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig01) depicts several VMs residing in a physical computer. The physical computer is called the “host computer” and the VMs are called “guest computers.” [Figure 16.1](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig01) also shows a hypervisor, which is an operating system for the VMs. This hypervisor runs directly on the physical computer hardware and is often called a bare-metal or Type 1 hypervisor. The VMs that it hosts implement applications and services. Bare-metal hypervisors typically run in a data center or cloud. ![An illustration of a bare-metal hypervisor and VMs is presented. A host computer is shown in a large block. The virtual machines VM1, VM2, and VM3 are shown inside the host computer. The hypervisor is shown inside the host computer at the bottom.](graphics/16fig01.jpg) Figure 16.1 Bare-metal hypervisor and VMs [Figure 16.2](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig02) depicts another type of hypervisor, called a hosted or Type 2 hypervisor. In this case, the hypervisor runs as a service on top of a host operating system, and the hypervisor in turn hosts one or more VMs. Hosted hypervisors are typically used on desktop or laptop computers. They allow developers to run and test applications that are not compatible with the computer’s host operating system (e.g., to run Linux applications on a Windows computer or to run Windows applications on an Apple computer). They can also be used to replicate a production environment on a development computer, even if the operating system is the same on both. This approach ensures that the development and production environments match each other.
