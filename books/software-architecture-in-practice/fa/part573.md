### 18.1 Energy In this section, we focus on the architectural concerns most relevant to managing the energy of mobile systems. For many mobile devices, their source of energy is a battery with a very finite capacity for delivering that energy. Other mobile devices, such as cars and planes, run on the power produced by generators, which in turn may be powered by engines that run on fuel—again, a finite resource. #### The Architect’s Concerns The architect must be concerned with monitoring the power source, throttling energy usage, and tolerating loss of power. We elaborate on these concerns in the next three subsections. ##### Monitoring the Power Source In [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#ch06) on energy efficiency, we introduced a category of tactics called “resource monitoring” for monitoring the usage of computational resources, which are consumers of energy. In mobile systems, we need to monitor the energy source, so that we can initiate appropriate behavior when the energy available becomes low. Specifically, in a mobile device powered by a battery, we may need to inform a user that the battery level is low, put the device into battery-saving mode, alert applications to the imminent shutdown of the device so they can prepare for a restart, and determine the power usage of each application.
