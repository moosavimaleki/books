As we proceeded to step 8, analyzing the architecture using the scenarios previously captured, the designers did an astonishingly good job of working together to answer our questions. Nobody knew everything, but everybody knew something. Together in a half day, they produced a clear and consistent picture of the whole architecture that was much more coherent and understandable than anything the architect had been willing to produce in two whole days of pre-exercise discussion. And by the end of phase 2, the design team was transformed. This erstwhile group of information-starved individuals with limited compartmentalized knowledge became a true architecture team. The members drew out and recognized each other’s expertise. This expertise was revealed and validated in front of everyone—and most important, in front of their project manager, who had slipped back into the room to observe. There was a look of supreme satisfaction on his face. It began to dawn on me that—you guessed it—it was okay.
