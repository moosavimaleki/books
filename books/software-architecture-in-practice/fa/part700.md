Once the scenarios have been collected, they must be prioritized, for the same reasons that the scenarios in the utility tree needed to be prioritized: The evaluation team needs to know where to devote its limited analysis time. First, stakeholders are asked to merge scenarios they feel represent the same behavior or quality concern. Next, they vote for those scenarios they feel are most important. Each stakeholder is allocated a number of votes equal to 30 percent of the number of scenarios,[1](ch21.xhtml#ch21fn1a) rounded up. Thus, if 40 scenarios were collected, each stakeholder would be given 12 votes. These votes can be allocated in any way that the stakeholder sees fit: all 12 votes for 1 scenario, 1 vote for each of 12 distinct scenarios, or anything in between. [1](ch21.xhtml#ch21fn1). This is a common facilitated brainstorming technique. The list of prioritized scenarios is compared with those from the utility tree exercise. If they agree, it indicates good alignment between what the architect had in mind and what the stakeholders actually wanted. If additional driving scenarios are discovered—and they usually are—this may itself be a risk, if the discrepancy is large. Such discoveries indicate some level of disagreement about the system’s important goals between the stakeholders and the architect.
