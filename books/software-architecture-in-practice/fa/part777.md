### 22.9 Practical Considerations Up to now, this chapter has been concerned with the information that architecture documentation should contain. Over and above the contents of architecture documentation, however, are issues dealing with its form, distribution, and evolution. In this section, we discuss some of these concerns. #### Modeling Tools Many commercially available modeling tools are available that support the specification of architectural constructs in a defined notation; SysML is a widely used choice. Many of these tools offer features aimed at practical large-scale use in industrial settings: interfaces that support multiple users, version control, syntactic and semantic consistency checking of the models, support for trace links between models and requirements or models and tests, and, in some cases, automatic generation of executable source code that implements the models. In many projects, these are must-have capabilities, so the purchase price of the tool—which is not insignificant in some cases—should be evaluated against what it would cost the project to achieve these capabilities on its own.
