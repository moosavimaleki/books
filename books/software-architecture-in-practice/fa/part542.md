### 17.2 Failure in the Cloud When a data center contains tens of thousands of physical computers, it is almost a certainty that one or more will fail every day. Amazon reports that in a data center with around 64,000 computers, each with two spinning disk drives, approximately 5 computers and 17 disks will fail every day. Google reports similar statistics. In addition to computer and disk failures, network switches can fail; the data center can overheat, causing all the computers to fail; or some natural disaster may bring the entire data center down. Although your cloud provider will have relatively few total outages, the physical computer on which your specific VM is running may fail. If availability is important to your service, you need to think carefully about what level of availability you wish to achieve and how to achieve it. Weâ€™ll discuss two concepts especially relevant to failure in the cloud: timeouts and long tail latency.
