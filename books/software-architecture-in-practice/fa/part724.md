2.  Architecture documentation serves as a primary vehicle for communication among stakeholders. Its precise use as a communication vehicle depends on which stakeholders are doing the communicating. Perhaps one of the most avid consumers of architecture documentation is none other than the projectâ€™s future architect. That may be the same person (as noted in the quotation that opened this chapter) or it may be a replacement, but in either case the future architect is guaranteed to have an enormous stake in the documentation. New architects are interested in learning how their predecessors tackled the difficult issues of the system and why particular decisions were made. Even if the future architect is the same person, he or she will use the documentation as a repository of thought, a storehouse of design decisions too numerous and hopelessly intertwined to ever be reproducible from memory alone. We enumerate the stakeholders for architecture, and its documentation, in [Section 22.8](ch22.xhtml#ch22lev1sec8).
