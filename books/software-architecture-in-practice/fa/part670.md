It is important to establish clear criteria that will allow a driver to be moved to the “Partially Addressed” or “Completely Addressed” columns. A criterion for “Completely Addressed” may be, for example, that the driver has been analyzed or that it has been implemented in a prototype, and you determine that the requirements for that driver have been satisfied. Drivers that are selected for a particular iteration may not be completely addressed in that iteration. In that case, they should remain in the “Partially Addressed” column. It can be useful to select a technique that will allow you to differentiate the entries in the board according to their priority. For example, you might use different colors for entries, depending on the priority. A Kanban board makes it easy to visually track the advancement of design, as you can quickly see how many of the (most important) drivers are being or have been addressed in the iteration. This technique also helps you decide whether you need to perform additional iterations. Ideally, the design round is terminated when a majority of your drivers (or at least the ones with the highest priority) are located under the “Completely Addressed” column.
