##### Step 5: Generate a Quality Attribute Utility Tree The quality attribute goals are articulated in detail via a quality attribute utility tree, which we introduced in [Section 19.4](ch19.xhtml#ch19lev1sec4). Utility trees serve to make the requirements concrete by defining precisely the relevant quality attribute requirements that the architects were working to provide. The important quality attribute goals for the architecture under consideration were named or implied in step 2, when the business goals were presented, but not with a degree of specificity that would permit analysis. Broad goals such as “modifiability” or “high throughput” or “ability to be ported to a number of platforms” establish context and direction, and provide a backdrop against which subsequent information is presented. However, they are not specific enough to let us tell if the architecture suffices to achieve those aims. Modifiable in what way? Throughput that is how high? Ported to what platforms and in how much time? The answers to these kinds of questions are expressed as quality attribute scenarios representing architecturally significant requirements.
