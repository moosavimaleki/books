Sometimes the most convenient way to show a strong association between two views is to collapse them into a single combined view. A combined view contains elements and relations that come from two or more other views. Such views can be very useful as long as you do not try to overload them with too many mappings. The easiest way to merge views is to create an overlay that combines the information that would otherwise have appeared in two separate views. This works well if the relationship between the two views is tightâ€”that is, if there are strong associations between elements in one view and elements in the other view. In such a case, the structure described by the combined view will be easier to understand than the two views seen separately. In an overlay, the elements and the relations keep the types as defined in their constituent views. The following combinations of views often occur quite naturally:
