Given the many concerns that it must address, the hypervisor is a complicated piece of software. One concern with VMs is the overhead introduced by the sharing and isolation needed for virtualization. That is, how much slower does a service run on a virtual machine, compared to running directly in a bare-metal physical machine? The answer to this question is complicated: It depends on the characteristics of the service and on the virtualization technology used. For example, services that perform more disk and network I/O incur more overhead than services that do not share these host resources. Virtualization technology is improving all the time, but overheads of approximately 10% have been reported by Microsoft on its Hyper-V hypervisor.[2](ch16.xhtml#ch16fn2a) [2](ch16.xhtml#ch16fn2). [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/technical-guides/system-resource-costs-on-hyper-v](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/technical-guides/system-resource-costs-on-hyper-v) There are two major implications of VMs for an architect: 1.  Performance. Virtualization incurs a performance cost. While Type 1 hypervisors carry only a modest performance penalty, Type 2 hypervisors may impose a significantly larger overhead.
