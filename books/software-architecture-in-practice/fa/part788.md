This chapter introduces a process to analyze existing systems for architecture debt. This process gives the architect both the knowledge and the tools to identify and manage such debt. It works by identifying architecturally connected elements—with problematic design relations—and analyzing a model of their maintenance costs. If that model indicates the existence of a problem, typically signaled by an unusually high amount of changes and bugs, this signifies an area of architecture debt. Once architecture debt has been identified, if it is bad enough, it should be removed through refactoring. Without quantitative evidence of payoff, typically it is difficult to get project stakeholders to agree to this step. The business case (without architecture debt analysis) goes like this: “I will take three months to refactor this system and give you no new functionality.” What manager would agree to that? However, armed with the kinds of analyses we present here, you can make a very different pitch to your manager, one couched in terms of ROI and increased productivity that pays the refactoring effort back, and more, in a short time.
