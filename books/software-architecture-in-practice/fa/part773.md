Maintainers will want to see the same information as developers, as both must make their changes within the same constraints. But maintainers will also want to see a decomposition view that allows them to pinpoint the locations where a change will need to be carried out, and perhaps a uses view to help them build an impact analysis to fully scope out the effects of the change. In addition, they will want to see the design rationale, which will allow them to benefit from the architectâ€™s original thinking and save them time by identifying already discarded design alternatives. A maintainer, then, is likely to want to see the same views as the developers of a system do.
