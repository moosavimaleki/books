2.  Function. The next step is to run the software component together with other components of the lane keep assist function, such as a mapping component to identify highway exits, in a simulated environment. The aim is to validate the interfacing and safe concurrency when all components of the function are working together. Here, simulators are used to provide the software function with inputs that correspond to a vehicle driving down a marked road. 3.  Device. The bundled lane keep assist function, even if it passes the tests in the simulated environment and on the development computers, needs to be deployed on its target ECU and tested there for performance and stability. In this device test phase, the environment would still be simulated, but this time through simulated external inputs (messages from other ECUs, sensor inputs, and so forth) connected to the ECUâ€™s ports. 4.  System. In the final system integration testing phase, all devices with all functions and all components are built into full-size configurations, first in a test lab and then in a test prototype. For example, the lane keep assist function could be subjected to testing, along with its actions on the steering and acceleration/braking functions, while being fed a projected image or a video of the road. The role of these tests is to confirm that the integrated subsystems work together and deliver the desired functionality and system quality attributes.
