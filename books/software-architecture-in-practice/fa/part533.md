3. We have focused on isolation among VMs that are running at the same time on a hypervisor. VMs may shut down and stop executing, and new VMs may start up. What does a hypervisor do to maintain isolation, or prevent leakage, between VMs running at different times? Hint: Think about the management of memory, disk, virtual MAC, and IP addresses. 4. What set of services would it make sense to group into a Pod (as was done with service meshes) and why? 5. What are the security issues associated with containers? How would you mitigate them? 6. What are the concerns associated with employing virtualization technologies in embedded systems? 7. What class of integration and deployment errors can be avoided with VMs, containers, and Pods? What class cannot?
