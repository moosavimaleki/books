*  Test for network transitions. Ensuring that the system makes the best choice when multiple communication networks are available is also difficult. As a device moves from one network to another (e.g., from a Wi-Fi network to a cellular network and then to a different Wi-Fi network), the user should be unaware of these transitions. Testing for transportation or industrial systems tends to happen on four levels: the individual software component level, the function level, the device level, and the system level. The levels and boundaries between them may vary depending on the system, but they are implied in several reference processes and standards such as Automotive SPICE. For example, suppose we are testing a car’s lane keep assist function, where the vehicle stays in the lane defined by markings on the road and does so without driver input. Testing of this system may address the following levels: 1.  Software component. A lane detection software component will be tested through the usual techniques for unit and end-to-end testing, with the aim of validating the software’s stability and correctness.
