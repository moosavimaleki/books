#### Evaluation by Outsiders Outside evaluators can cast a more objective eye on an architecture. “Outside” is relative; this may mean outside the development project, outside the business unit where the project resides but within the same company, or outside the company altogether. To the degree that evaluators are “outside,” they are less likely to be afraid to bring up sensitive problems, or problems that aren’t apparent because of organizational culture or because “we’ve always done it that way.” Often, outsiders are chosen to participate in the evaluation because they possess specialized knowledge or experience, such as knowledge about a quality attribute that’s important to the system being examined, skill with a particular technology being employed, or long experience in successfully evaluating architectures. Also, whether justified or not, managers tend to be more inclined to listen to problems uncovered by an outside team hired at considerable cost than by team members within the organization. This can be understandably frustrating to project staff who may have been complaining about the same problems, to no avail, for months.
