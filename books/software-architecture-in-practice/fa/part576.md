The system’s computer (re)starts the OS robustly whenever sufficient power is provided. The system’s OS has the software scheduled to launch as soon as the OS is ready. *  The system’s computer does not suffer permanent damage if power is cut at any time. *  The system’s computer (re)starts the OS robustly whenever sufficient power is provided. *  The system’s OS has the software scheduled to launch as soon as the OS is ready.
