3.  No influence of a business goal on the architecture. Not all business goals lead to quality attributes. For example, a business goal to “reduce cost” might be realized by lowering the facility’s thermostats in the winter or reducing employees’ salaries or pensions. [Figure 19.1](ch19.xhtml#ch19fig01) illustrates the major points from this discussion. In the figure, the arrows mean “leads to.” The solid arrows highlight the relationships of greatest interest to architects. ![A figure of business goals leading towards the quality attribute requirements.](graphics/19fig01.jpg) Figure 19.1 Some business goals may lead to quality attribute requirements, or lead directly to architectural decisions, or lead to non-architectural solutions. An illustration shows business goals on the top left. A vertical dashed arrow from the business goals points to the nonarchitectural solutions at the bottom. A right arrow from the business goals points to the quality attributes on the right. A vertical arrow from the quality attributes points to the architecture at the bottom. A slanting arrow from the business goals towards the right points to the architecture at the bottom right.
