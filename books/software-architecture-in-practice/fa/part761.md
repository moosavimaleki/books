The associations between elements across views in an architecture are, in general, many-to-many. For instance, each module may map to multiple runtime elements, and each runtime element may map to multiple modules. View-to-view associations can be conveniently captured as tables. To create such a table list the elements of the first view in some convenient lookup order. The table itself should be annotated or introduced with an explanation of the association that it depicts—that is, the correspondence between the elements across the two views. Examples include “is implemented by” for mapping from a component-and-connector view to a module view, “implements” for mapping from a module view to a component-and-connector view, “included in” for mapping from a decomposition view to a layered view, and many others. *  Documenting patterns. If you employ patterns in your design, as recommended in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20), these patterns should be identified in the documentation. First, record the fact that the given pattern is being used. Then say why this solution approach was chosen—why the pattern is appropriate for the problem at hand. Using a pattern involves making successive design decisions that eventually result in that pattern’s instantiation. These design decisions may manifest themselves as newly instantiated elements and the relations among them, which in turn should be documented in structural views.
