Two techniques to handle long tail problems are hedged requests and alternative requests. *  Hedged requests. Make more requests than are needed and then cancel the requests (or ignore responses) after sufficient responses have been received. For example, suppose 10 instances of a microservice (see [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05)) are to be launched. Issue 11 requests and after 10 have completed, terminate the request that has not responded yet. *  Alternative requests. A variant of the hedged request technique is called alternative request. In the just-described scenario, issue 10 requests. When 8 requests have completed, issue 2 more, and when a total of 10 responses have been received, cancel the 2 requests that are still remaining. ### 17.3 Using Multiple Instances to Improve Performance and Availability If a service hosted in a cloud receives more requests than it can process within the required latency, the service becomes overloaded. This can occur because there is an insufficient I/O bandwidth, CPU cycles, memory, or some other resource. In some cases, you can resolve a service overload issue by running the service in a different instance type that provides more of the resource that is needed. This approach is simple: The design of the service does not change; instead, the service just runs on a larger virtual machine. Called vertical scaling or scaling up, this approach corresponds to the increase resources performance tactic from [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09).
