#### Documenting Architectures That Change Dynamically When your web browser encounters a file type it’s never seen before, odds are that it will go to the Internet, search for and download the appropriate plug-in to handle the file, install it, and reconfigure itself to use it. Without even needing to shut down, let alone go through the code–integrate–test development cycle, the browser is able to change its own architecture by adding a new component. Service-oriented systems that utilize dynamic service discovery and binding also exhibit these properties. More challenging systems that are highly dynamic, self-organizing, and reflective (meaning self-aware) already exist. In these cases, the identities of the components interacting with each other cannot be pinned down, let alone their interactions, in any static architecture document. Another kind of architectural dynamism, equally challenging from a documentation perspective, is found in systems that are rebuilt and redeployed with great rapidity. Some development shops, such as those responsible for commercial websites, build and “go live” with their system many times every day.
