#### Use of a Design Kanban Board Another tool that can be used to track design progress is a Kanban board, such as the one shown in [Figure 20.5](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig05). This board establishes three categories of backlog items: “Not Yet Addressed,” “Partially Addressed,” and “Completely Addressed.” ![A block diagram shows the Kanban board.](graphics/20fig05.jpg) Figure 20.5 A Kanban board used to track design progress An illustration depicts the Kanban board in three columns not yet addressed, partially addressed, and completely addressed. A QA scenario and a constraint high priority labels are displayed at the top of the not yet addressed column. A QA scenario and constraint medium priority labels are displayed at the bottom of the not yet addressed column. A QA scenario and use high priority labels and low priority labels are displayed in the partially addressed column. A concern high priority label is shown in the completely addressed column. At the beginning of an iteration, the inputs to the design process become entries in the backlog. Initially (in step 1), the entries in your backlog for this design round should be located in the “Not Yet Addressed” column of the board. When you begin a design iteration, in step 2, the backlog entries that correspond to the drivers that you address in the design iteration goal should be moved to the “Partially Addressed” column. Finally, once you finish an iteration and the analysis of your design decisions reveals that a particular driver has been addressed (step 7), the entry should be moved to the “Completely Addressed” column of the board.
