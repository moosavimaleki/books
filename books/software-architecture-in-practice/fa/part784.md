AADL ([addl.info](http://addl.info)) is an architecture description language that has become an SAE standard for documenting architectures. The SAE is an organization for engineering professionals in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle industries. SysML is a general-purpose systems modeling language intended to support a broad range of analysis and design activities for systems engineering applications. It is defined so that sufficient detail can be specified to support a variety of automated analysis and design tools. The SysML standard is maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG); this language was developed by OMG in cooperation with the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE). SysML was developed as a profile of UML, which means that it reuses much of UML, but also provides the extensions necessary to meet the needs of systems engineers. Copious information about SysML is available online, but Appendix C of [[Clements 10a](ref01.xhtml#ref_63)] discusses how SysML can be used to document architectures. As this book went to press, SysML 2.0 was under development.
