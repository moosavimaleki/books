The computing capabilities delivered from the cloud range from applications such as photo (or other kinds of digital artifact) storage, to fine-grained services exposed through APIs (e.g., text translation or currency conversion), to low-level infrastructure services such as processors, network, and storage virtualization. In this chapter, we will focus on how a software architect can use infrastructure services from the cloud to deliver the services that the architect is designing and developing. Along the way, we will take a journey into some of the most important principles and techniques of distributed computing. This means using multiple (real or virtual) computers to work cooperatively together, thereby producing faster performance and a more robust system than a single computer doing all the work. We included this subject matter in this chapter because nowhere is distributed computing more ingrained than in cloud-based systems. The treatment we give here is a brief overview of the principles most relevant to architecture.
