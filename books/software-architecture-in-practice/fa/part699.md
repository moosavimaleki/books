In phase 2, step 1 is repeated so that the stakeholders understand the method and the roles they are to play. Then the evaluation leader recaps the results of steps 2–6, and shares the current list of risks, non-risks, sensitivity points, and tradeoffs. After bringing the stakeholders up to speed with the evaluation results so far, the remaining three steps can be carried out. ##### Step 7: Brainstorm and Prioritize Scenarios The evaluation team asks the stakeholders to brainstorm quality attribute scenarios that are operationally meaningful with respect to the stakeholders’ individual roles. A maintainer will likely propose a modifiability scenario, while a user will probably come up with a scenario that expresses ease of operation, and a quality assurance person will propose a scenario about testing the system or being able to replicate the state of the system leading up to a fault. While utility tree generation (step 5) is used primarily to understand how the architect perceived and handled quality attribute architectural drivers, the purpose of scenario brainstorming is to take the pulse of the larger stakeholder community: to understand what system success means for them. Scenario brainstorming works well in larger groups, creating an atmosphere in which the ideas and thoughts of one person stimulate others’ ideas.
