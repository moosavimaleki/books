*  From a client’s perspective, the service’s IP address is actually the address of the load balancer. This address may be associated with a hostname in the DNS. The client does not know, or need to know, how many instances of the service exist or the IP address of any of those service instances. This makes the client resilient to changing this information—an example of using an intermediary, as discussed in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08). *  Multiple clients may coexist. Each client sends its messages to the load balancer, which does not care about the message source. The load balancer distributes the messages as they arrive. (We’ll ignore the concept called “sticky sessions” or “session affinity” for the moment.) *  Load balancers may get overloaded. In this case, the solution is to balance the load of the load balancer, sometimes referred to as global load balancing. That is, a message goes through a hierarchy of load balancers before arriving at the service instance.
