We first discuss how the cloud provides and manages virtual machines. ### 17.1 Cloud Basics Public clouds are owned and provided by cloud service providers. These organizations provide infrastructure services to anyone who agrees to the terms of service and can pay for use of the services. In general, the services you build using this infrastructure are accessible on the public Internet, although you can provision mechanisms such as firewalls to restrict visibility and access. Some organizations operate a private cloud. A private cloud is owned and operated by an organization for the use of members of that organization. An organization might choose to operate a private cloud because of concerns such as control, security, and cost. In this case, the cloud infrastructure and the services developed on it are visible and accessible only within the organizationâ€™s network. The hybrid cloud approach is a mixed model, in which some workloads are run in a private cloud and other workloads are run in a public cloud. A hybrid cloud might be used during a migration from a private cloud to a public cloud (or vice versa), or it might be used because some data are legally required to be subject to greater control and scrutiny than is possible with a public cloud.
