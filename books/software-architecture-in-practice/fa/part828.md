*  Asynchronous electronic communication. Various forms of asynchronous electronic communication can be used as a coordination mechanism, such as email, news groups, blogs, and wikis. The choice of coordination method depends on many factors, including the organizationâ€™s infrastructure, corporate culture, language skills, time zones involved, and number of teams dependent on a particular module. Until an organization has established a working method for coordinating among distributed teams, misunderstandings among the teams will likely cause delays and, in some cases, serious defects in a project. What does this mean for architecture and the architect? It means that allocation of responsibilities to teams is more important in distributed development than in co-located development, where all of the developers are in a single office, or at least in close proximity. It also means that attention to module dependencies takes on added importance over and above their usual role in quality attributes such as modifiability and performance: Dependencies among modules owned by globally distributed teams are more likely to be problematic and should be minimized to the extent possible.
