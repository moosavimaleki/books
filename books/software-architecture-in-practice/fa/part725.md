3.  Architecture documentation serves as the basis for system analysis and construction. Architecture tells implementers which modules to implement and how those modules are wired together. These dependencies determine the other teams with which the development team for the module must communicate. For those interested in the design’s ability to meet the system’s quality objectives, the architecture documentation serves as fodder for evaluation. It must contain the information necessary to evaluate a variety of attributes, such as security, performance, usability, availability, and modifiability. 4.  Architecture documentation serves as the basis for forensics when an incident occurs. When an incident occurs, someone is responsible for tracking down both the immediate cause of the incident and the underlying cause. Information about the flow of control immediately prior to the incident will provide the “as executed” architecture. For example, a database of interface specifications will provide context for the flow of control, and component descriptions will indicate what should have happened in each component on the trace of events.
