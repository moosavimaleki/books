*  Scenario brainstorming. Each stakeholder expresses a scenario representing his or her concerns with respect to the system. Facilitators ensure that each scenario addresses a QA concern, by specifying an explicit stimulus and response. *  Scenario consolidation. After the scenario brainstorming, similar scenarios are consolidated where reasonable. Facilitators ask stakeholders to identify those scenarios that are very similar in content. Scenarios that are similar are merged, as long as the people who proposed them agree and feel that their scenarios will not be diluted in the process. *  Scenario prioritization. Prioritization of the scenarios is accomplished by allocating each stakeholder a number of votes equal to 30 percent of the total number of scenarios generated after consolidation. Stakeholders can allocate any number of their votes to any scenario or combination of scenarios. The votes are counted, and the scenarios are prioritized accordingly. *  Scenario refinement. After the prioritization, the top scenarios are refined and elaborated. Facilitators help the stakeholders put the scenarios in the six-part scenario form of source–stimulus–artifact–environment–response–response measure that we described in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03). As the scenarios are refined, issues surrounding their satisfaction will emerge and should be recorded. This step lasts as long as time and resources allow.
