*  Allocation views. A deployment view to understand how functionality is allocated to the platforms with which the users interact. *  Other. Context diagrams. *  Analysts are interested in whether the design meets the systemâ€™s quality objectives. The architecture serves as fodder for architecture evaluation methods and must provide the information necessary to evaluate quality attributes. For example, architecture includes the model that drives such analytical tools as rate-monotonic real-time schedulability analysis, reliability block diagrams, simulations and simulation generators, theorem provers, and model checkers. These tools require information about resource consumption, scheduling policies, dependencies, component failure rates, and so forth. Because analysis can encompass almost any subject matter area, analysts may need access to information documented in any part of the architecture documentation. *  Infrastructure support personnel set up and maintain the infrastructure that supports the development, integration, staging, and production environments of the system. A variability guide is particularly useful to help set up the software configuration management environment. Infrastructure support people likely want to see the following views:
