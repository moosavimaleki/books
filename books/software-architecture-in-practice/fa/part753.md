*  Use cases describe how actors can use a system to accomplish their goals; they are frequently used to capture the functional requirements for a system. UML provides a graphical notation for use case diagrams but does not specify how the text of a use case should be written. The UML use case diagram is a good way to provide an overview of the actors and the behavior of a system. Its description, which is textual, should include the following items: the use case name and a brief description, the actor or actors who initiate the use case (primary actors), other actors who participate in the use case (secondary actors), the flow of events, alternative flows, and non-success cases. *  A UML sequence diagram shows a sequence of interactions among instances of elements pulled from the structural documentation. It is useful, when designing a system, for identifying where interfaces need to be defined. The sequence diagram shows only the instances participating in the scenario being documented. It has two dimensions: vertical, representing time, and horizontal, representing the various instances. The interactions are arranged in time sequence from top to bottom. [Figure 22.2](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig02) is an example of a sequence diagram that illustrates the basic UML notation. Sequence diagrams are not explicit about showing concurrency. If that is your goal, use activity diagrams instead.
