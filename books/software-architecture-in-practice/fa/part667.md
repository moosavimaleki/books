Finally, remember as you are documenting that your design may eventually be analyzed. Consequently, you need to think about which information should be documented to support this analysis. #### Recording Design Decisions In each design iteration, you will make important design decisions to achieve your iteration goal. When you study a diagram that represents an architecture, you might see the end product of a thought process but can’t always easily understand the decisions that were made to achieve this result. Recording design decisions beyond the representation of the chosen elements, relationships, and properties is fundamental to help clarify how you arrived at the result—that is, the design rationale. We delve into this topic in detail in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22). ### 20.6 More on ADD Step 7: Perform Analysis of the Current Design and Review the Iteration Goal and Achievement of the Design Purpose At the end of an iteration, it is prudent to do some analysis to reflect on the design decisions that you just made. We describe several techniques to do so in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21). One kind of analysis that you need to perform at this point is to assess whether you have done enough design work. In particular:
