But does it pay to do these kinds of refactorings? After all, not all debts are worth paying off. This is the topic of the next section. #### Quantifying Architecture Debt Because the remediations suggested by the analysis are very specific, the architect can easily estimate the number of person-months required for each of the refactorings identified on the basis of the anti-patterns in the hotspots. The other side of the cost/benefit equation is the benefit from the refactorings. To estimate the savings, we make one assumption: The refactored files will have roughly the same number of bug fixes in the future as the average file had in the past. This is actually a very conservative assumption since the average number of bug fixes in the past was inflated by those files in the identified hotspots. Moreover, this calculation does not consider other significant costs of bugs, such as lost reputation, lost sales, and additional quality assurance and debugging effort.
