### 19.2 Gathering ASRs by Interviewing Stakeholders Suppose your project isn’t producing a comprehensive requirements document. Or maybe it is, but it won’t have the QAs nailed down by the time you need to start your design work. What do you do? First, stakeholders often don’t know what their QA requirements actually are. In that case, architects are called upon to help set the QA requirements for a system. Projects that recognize this need for collaboration and encourage it are much more likely to be successful than those that don’t. Relish the opportunity! No amount of nagging your stakeholders will suddenly instill in them the necessary insights. If you insist on quantitative QA requirements, you may get numbers that are arbitrary and at least some of those requirements will be difficult to satisfy and, in the end, actually detract from system success. Experienced architects often have deep insights into which QA responses have been exhibited by similar systems, and which QA responses are reasonable to expect and to provide in the current context. Architects can also usually give quick feedback as to which QA responses will be straightforward to achieve and which will likely be problematic or even prohibitive.
