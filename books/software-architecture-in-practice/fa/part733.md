Supporting the definition of work assignments, implementation schedules, and budget information *  Showing the data model Properties of modules that help to guide implementation or are input into analysis should be recorded as part of the supporting documentation for a module view. The list of properties may vary but is likely to include the following: *  Name. A module’s name is, of course, the primary means to refer to it. A module’s name often suggests something about its role in the system. In addition, a module’s name may reflect its position in a decomposition hierarchy; the name A.B.C, for example, refers to a module C that is a submodule of a module B, which is itself a submodule of A. *  Responsibilities. The responsibility property for a module is a way to identify its role in the overall system and establishes an identity for it beyond the name. Whereas a module’s name may suggest its role, a statement of responsibility establishes that role with much more certainty. Responsibilities should be described in sufficient detail to make clear to the reader what each module does. A module’s responsibilities are often captured by tracing to a project’s requirements specification, if there is one.
