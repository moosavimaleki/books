Frequently, there is a need to share information across all instances of a service. This information may consist of state information, as discussed earlier, or it may be other information that is needed for the service instances to work together efficientlyâ€”for example, the IP address of the load balancer for the service. A solution exists to manage relatively small amounts of information shared among all instances of a service, as discussed next. #### Time Coordination in a Distributed System Determining exactly what time it is might seem to be a trivial task, but it is actually not easy. Hardware clocks found in computers will gain or lose one second about every 12 days. If your computing device is out in the world, so to speak, it may have access to a time signal from a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite, which provides a time accurate to within 100 nanoseconds or less.
