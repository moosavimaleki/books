*  Formal notations. Views may be described in a notation that has a precise (usually mathematically based) semantics. Formal analysis of both syntax and semantics is possible. A variety of formal notations for software architecture are available. Generally referred to as architecture description languages (ADLs), they typically provide both a graphical vocabulary and an underlying semantics for architecture representation. In some cases, these notations are specialized to particular architectural views. In other cases, they allow many views, or even provide the ability to formally define new views. The usefulness of ADLs lies in their ability to support automation through associated toolsâ€”automation to provide useful analysis of the architecture, or assist in code generation. In practice, the use of formal notations is rare. Typically, more formal notations take more time and effort to create and understand, but repay this effort with reduced ambiguity and more opportunities for analysis. Conversely, more informal notations are easier to create, but provide fewer guarantees.
