Containers are a mechanism to maintain most of the advantages of virtualization while reducing the image transfer time and startup time. Like VMs and VM images, containers are packaged into executable container images for transfer. (However, this terminology is not always followed in practice.) Reexamining [Figure 16.1](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig01), we see that a VM executes on virtualized hardware under the control of the hypervisor. In [Figure 16.3](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig03), we see several containers operating under the control of a container runtime engine, which in turn is running on top of a fixed operating system. The container runtime engine acts as a virtualized operating system. Just as all VMs on a physical host share the same underlying physical hardware, all containers within a host share the same operating system kernel through the runtime engine (and through the operating system, they share the same underlying physical hardware). The operating system can be loaded either onto a bare-metal physical machine or a virtual machine.
