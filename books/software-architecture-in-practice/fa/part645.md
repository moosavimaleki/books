In addition to capturing the sketches of the views, you should record the significant decisions made in the design iteration, as well as the reasons that motivated these decisions (i.e., the rationale), to facilitate later analysis and understanding of the decisions. For example, decisions about important tradeoffs should be recorded at this time. During a design iteration, decisions are primarily made in steps 4 and 5. In [Section 20.5](ch20.xhtml#ch20lev1sec5), we explain how to create preliminary documentation during the design process, including recording design decisions and their rationale. #### Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose By step 7, you should have created a partial design that addresses the goal established for the iteration. Making sure that this is actually the case is a good idea, to avoid unhappy stakeholders and later rework. You can perform the analysis yourself by reviewing the sketches of the views and design decisions that you captured, but an even better idea is to have someone else help you review this design. We do this for the same reason that organizations frequently have a separate testing/quality assurance group: Another person will not share your assumptions, and will have a different experience base and a different perspective. This diversity helps to find “bugs,” in both code and architecture. We discuss architectural analysis in more depth in [Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#ch21).
