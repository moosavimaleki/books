*  Connectivity. Some functions may be split among several ECUs. If so, they must be on the same internal network and able to communicate with each other. *  Locality of communication. Putting components that intensely communicate with each other on the same ECU will improve their performance and reduce network traffic. *  Cost. Typically a manufacturer wants to minimize the number of ECUs deployed. *  Offloading functionality to the cloud. Applications such as route determination and pattern recognition can be performed partly by the mobile system itself—where the sensors are located—and partly from portions of the application that are resident on the cloud—where more data storage and more powerful processors are available. The architect must determine whether the mobile system has sufficient power for specific functions, whether there is adequate connectivity to offload some functions, and how to satisfy performance requirements when the functions are split between the mobile system and the cloud. The architect should also take into consideration data storage available locally, data update intervals, and privacy concerns.
