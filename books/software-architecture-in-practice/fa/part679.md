4.  The reviewers capture potential problems exposed during the prior step. This list of potential problems forms the basis for the follow-up of the review. If the potential problem is a real problem, then either it must be fixed or a decision must be explicitly made by the designers and the project manager that they are willing to accept the risk. How much analysis should you do? Decisions made to achieve one of the driving architectural requirements should be subject to more analysis than others, because they will shape critical portions of the architecture. Some specific considerations include these: *  The importance of the decision. The more important the decision, the more care should be taken in making it and making sure itâ€™s right. *  The number of potential alternatives. The more alternatives, the more time could be spent in evaluating them. *  Good enough as opposed to perfect. Many times, two possible alternatives do not differ dramatically in their consequences. In such a case, it is more important to make a choice and move on with the design process than it is to be absolutely certain that the best choice is being made.
