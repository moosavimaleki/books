#### Component-and-Connector Views C&C views show elements that have some runtime presence, such as processes, services, objects, clients, servers, and data stores. These elements are termed components. Additionally, C&C views include as elements the pathways of interaction, such as communication links and protocols, information flows, and access to shared storage. Such interactions are represented as connectors in C&C views. Example C&C views include client-server, microservice, and communicating processes. A component in a C&C view may represent a complex subsystem, which itself can be described as a C&C subarchitecture. A componentâ€™s subarchitecture may employ a different pattern than the one in which the component appears. Simple examples of connectors include service invocation, asynchronous message queues, event multicast supporting publish-subscribe interactions, and pipes that represent asynchronous, order-preserving data streams. Connectors often represent much more complex forms of interaction, such as a transaction-oriented communication channel between a database server and a client, or an enterprise service bus that mediates interactions between collections of service users and providers.
