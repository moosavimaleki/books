The user interface typically operates asynchronously from the software that provides the functionality. When the user interface does not react correctly, re-creating the sequence of events that caused the problem is difficult because the problem may depend on the timing, or on a specific set of operations in progress at the time. *  An application should survive battery exhaustion and shutdown of the system. The preservation of state in such cases needs to be ensured and tested. *  The user interface typically operates asynchronously from the software that provides the functionality. When the user interface does not react correctly, re-creating the sequence of events that caused the problem is difficult because the problem may depend on the timing, or on a specific set of operations in progress at the time. *  Test resource usage. Some vendors will make simulators of their devices available to software architects. Thatâ€™s helpful, but testing battery usage with a simulator is problematic.
