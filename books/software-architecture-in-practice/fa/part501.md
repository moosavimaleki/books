### 15.4 Summary Architectural elements have interfaces, which are boundaries over which elements interact with each other. Interface design is an architectural duty, because compatible interfaces allow architectures with many elements to do something productive and useful together. A primary use of an interface is to encapsulate an element’s implementation, so that this implementation may change without affecting other elements. Elements may have multiple interfaces, providing different types of access and privileges to different classes of actors. Interfaces state which resources the element provides to its actors as well as what the element needs from its environment to function correctly. Like architectures themselves, interfaces should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. Interfaces have operations, events, and properties; these are the parts of an interface that the architect can design. To do so, the architect must decide the element’s *  Interface scope *  Interaction style *  Representation, structure, and semantics of the exchanged data
