A VM is booted just as a bare-metal physical machine is booted. When the machine begins executing, it automatically reads a special program called the boot loader from disk storage, either internal to the computer or connected through a network. The boot loader reads the operating system code from disk into memory, and then transfers execution to the operating system. In the case of a physical computer, the connection to the disk drive is made during the power-up process. In the case of the VM, the connection to the disk drive is established by the hypervisor when it starts the VM. The “VM Images” section discusses this process in more detail. From the perspective of the operating system and software services inside a VM, it appears as if the software is executing inside of a bare-metal physical machine. The VM provides a CPU, memory, I/O devices, and a network connection.
