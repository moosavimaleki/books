2.  Memory. A physical computer has a fixed amount of physical memory. 3.  Disk storage. Disks provide persistent storage for instructions and data, across reboots and shutdowns of the computer. A physical computer typically has one or more attached disks, each with a fixed amount of storage capacity. Disk storage can refer to either a rotating magnetic or optical hard disk drive device, or a solid-state disk drive device; the latter has neither disks nor any moving parts to drive. 4.  Network connection. Today, every nontrivial physical computer has one or more network connections through which all messages pass. Now that we have enumerated the resources that we want to share, we need to think about how to share them, and how to do this in a sufficiently “isolated” way so that different applications are unaware of each other’s existence. Processor sharing is achieved through a thread-scheduling mechanism. The scheduler selects and assigns an execution thread to an available processor, and that thread maintains control until the processor is rescheduled. No application thread can gain control of a processor without going through the scheduler. Rescheduling occurs when the thread yields control of the processor, when a fixed time interval expires, or when an interrupt occurs.
