Table 21.1 ATAM Evaluation Team Roles Role Responsibilities Team Leader Sets up the evaluation; coordinates with the client, making sure the client’s needs are met; establishes the evaluation contract; forms the evaluation team; sees that the final report is produced and delivered. Evaluation Leader Runs the evaluation; facilitates elicitation of scenarios; administers the scenario prioritization process; facilitates the evaluation of scenarios against the architecture. Scenario Scribe Writes scenarios in a sharable, public form during scenario elicitation; captures the agreed-on wording of each scenario, halting discussion until the exact wording is captured. E-Scribe Captures the proceedings in electronic form: raw scenarios, issue(s) that motivate each scenario (often lost in the wording of the scenario itself), and the results of each scenario’s analysis; also generates a list of adopted scenarios for distribution to all participants. Questioner Asks probing quality attribute–based questions. *  Project decision makers. These people are empowered to speak for the development project or have the authority to mandate changes to it. They usually include the project manager and, if an identifiable customer is footing the bill for the development, a representative of that customer may be present as well. The architect is always included—a cardinal rule of architecture evaluation is that the architect must willingly participate.
