Distributed development comes with both benefits and challenges: *  Cost. Labor costs vary depending on location, and there is a perception that moving some development to a low-cost venue will inevitably decrease the overall cost of the project. Indeed, experience has shown that, for software development, savings may be reaped in the long term. However, until the developers in the low-cost venue have a sufficient level of domain expertise and until the management practices are adapted to compensate for the difficulties of distributed development, a large amount of rework must be done, thereby cutting into and perhaps overwhelming any savings from wages. *  Skill sets and labor availability. Organizations may not be able to hire developers at a single location: Relocation costs may be high, the size of the developer pool may be small, or the skill sets needed may be specialized and unavailable in a single location. Developing a system in a distributed fashion allows for the work to move to where the workers are rather than forcing the workers to move to the work location, albeit at the cost of additional communication and coordination.
