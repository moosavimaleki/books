Prior to starting architecture design, it is important to determine the scope of the systemâ€”what is inside and what is outside of the system you are creating, and which external entities the system will interact with. This context can be represented using a system context diagram, like that shown in [Figure 20.2](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig02). Context diagrams are discussed in more detail in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22). ![A sample context diagram is shown.](graphics/20fig02.jpg) Figure 20.2 Example of a system context diagram The system context diagram is presented. The key to the diagram is displayed on the left as follows. A circle represents the system under development. A square represents the external system. A double horizontal line represents the data flow. The diagram is as follows. Three user workstations are shown one behind the other which is the external system is shown on the left. Three external services are shown one behind the other which is the external system is shown on the right. The system is designed which is the system under development is shown between the user workstations and external services. A database server (external system) is shown below the system being designed. The data from the user workstation, external services, and database server flow through the system being designed.
