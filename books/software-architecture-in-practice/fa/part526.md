Other differences between VMs and containers are as follows: *  Whereas a VM can run any operating system, containers are currently limited to Linux, Windows, or IOS. *  Services within the VM are started, stopped, and paused through operating system functions, whereas services within containers are started and stopped through container runtime engine functions. *  VMs persist beyond the termination of services running within them; containers do not. *  Some restrictions on port usage exist when using containers that do not exist when using VMs. ### 16.6 Container Portability We have introduced the concept of a container runtime manager with which the container interacts. Several vendors provide container runtime engines, most notably Docker, containerd, and Mesos. Each of these providers has a container runtime engine that provides capabilities to create container images and to allocate and execute container instances. The interface between the container runtime engine and the container has been standardized by the Open Container Initiative, allowing a container created by one vendorâ€™s package (say, Docker) to be executed on a container runtime engine provided by another vendor (say, containerd).
