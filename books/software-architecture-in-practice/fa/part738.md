Connectors need not be binary; that is, they need not have exactly two components with which they interact. For example, a publish-subscribe connector might have an arbitrary number of publishers and subscribers. Even if the connector is ultimately implemented using binary connectors, such as a procedure call, it can be useful to adopt n-ary connector representations in a C&C view. Connectors embody a protocol of interaction. When two or more components interact, they must obey conventions about order of interactions, locus of control, and handling of error conditions and timeouts. The protocol of interaction should be documented. The primary relation within a C&C view is attachment. Attachments indicate which connectors are attached to which components, thereby defining a system as a graph of components and connectors. Compatibility often is defined in terms of information type and protocol. For example, if a web server expects encrypted communication via HTTPS, then the client must perform the encryption.
