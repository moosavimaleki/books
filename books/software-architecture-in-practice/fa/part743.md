Elements Software element and environmental element. A software element has properties that are required of the environment. An environmental element has properties that are provided to the software. Relations Allocated-to: A software element is mapped (allocated to) an environmental element. Constraints Varies by view. Usage For reasoning about performance, availability, security, and safety. For reasoning about distributed development and allocation of work to teams. For reasoning about concurrent access to software versions. For reasoning about the form and mechanisms of system installation. The relation in an allocation view is allocated-to. We usually talk about allocation views in terms of a mapping from software elements to environmental elements, although the reverse mapping would also be relevant and potentially interesting. A single software element can be allocated to multiple environmental elements, and multiple software elements can be allocated to a single environmental element. If these allocations change over time, during execution of the system, then the architecture is said to be dynamic with respect to that allocation. For example, processes might migrate from one processor or virtual machine to another.
