Suppose you wish to have a VM allocated for you in the cloud. You send a request to the management gateway asking for a new VM instance. This request has many parameters, but three essential parameters are the cloud region where the new instance will run, the instance type (e.g., CPU and memory size), and the ID of a VM image. The management gateway is responsible for tens of thousands of physical computers, and each physical computer has a hypervisor that manages the VMs on it. So, the management gateway will identify a hypervisor that can manage an additional VM of the type you have selected by asking, Is there enough unallocated CPU and memory capacity available on that physical machine to meet your needs? If so, it will ask that hypervisor to create an additional VM; the hypervisor will perform this task and return the new VMâ€™s IP address to the management gateway. The management gateway then sends that IP address to you. The cloud provider ensures that enough physical hardware resources are available in its data centers so that your request will never fail due to insufficient resources.
