*  How much design do you need to do? *  How much design have you done so far? *  Are you finished? Practices such as the use of backlogs and Kanban boards can help you track the design progress and answer these questions. #### Use of an Architectural Backlog An architectural backlog is a to-do list of the pending actions that still need to be performed as part of the architecture design process. Initially, you should populate the design backlog with your drivers, but other activities that support the design of the architecture can also be includedâ€”for example: *  Creation of a prototype to test a particular technology or to address a specific QA risk *  Exploration and understanding of existing assets (possibly requiring reverse engineering) *  Issues uncovered in a review of the design decisions made to this point Also, you may add more items to the backlog as decisions are made. As a case in point, if you choose a reference architecture, you will probably need to add specific concerns, or QA scenarios derived from them, to the architectural design backlog. For example, if we choose a web application reference architecture and discover that it does not provide session management, then that becomes a concern that needs to be added to the backlog.
