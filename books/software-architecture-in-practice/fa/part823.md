Absolutely. So that’s six “Absolutely” agreements, four general agreements, and two strong disagreements. Agile, as it was first codified, seemed to work best in small organizations building small products. Organizations of medium to large size wishing to apply Agile to large projects quickly found that coordinating the large number of small Agile teams was a formidable challenge. In Agile, small teams do small pieces of work over small intervals. One challenge is ensuring that these many (dozens to hundreds) small teams have divided the work suitably so that no work is overlooked and no work is done twice. Another challenge is sequencing the teams’ many tasks so that their results can be amalgamated, frequently and quickly, to produce the next small increment of a sensibly working system. One example of an approach to apply Agile at enterprise scale is the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), which emerged around 2007 and has been refined continuously since then. SAFe provides a reference model of workflows, roles, and processes under which large organizations can coordinate the activities of many teams, each operating in classic Agile fashion, to systematically and successfully produce a large-scale system.
