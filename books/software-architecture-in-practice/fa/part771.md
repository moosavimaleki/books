*  Other. System overview; a context diagram containing the module(s) the developer has been assigned; the interface documentation of the developerâ€™s element(s) and the interface documentation of those elements with which they interact; a variability guide to implement required variability; and rationale and constraints. *  Testers and integrators are stakeholders for whom the architecture specifies the correct black-box behavior of the pieces that must fit together. A black-box tester will need to access the interface documentation for the element. Integrators and system testers need to see collections of interfaces, behavior specifications, and a uses view so they can work with incremental subsets. Testers and integrators, then, are likely to want to see the following views: Module views. Decomposition, uses, and data model. C&C views. All. Allocation views. Deployment; install; and implementation, to find out where the assets to build the module are. Other. Context diagrams showing the module(s) to be tested or integrated; the interface documentation and behavior specification(s) of the module(s) and the interface documentation of those elements with which they interact.
