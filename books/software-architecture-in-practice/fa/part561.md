Our last distributed computing topic is the automatic creation and destruction of instances. #### Autoscaling: Automatic Creation and Destruction of Instances Consider a traditional data center, where your organization owns all the physical resources. In this environment, your organization needs to allocate enough physical hardware to a system to handle the peak of the largest workload that it has committed to process. When the workload is less than the peak, some (or much) of the hardware capacity allocated to the system is idle. Now compare this to a cloud environment. Two of the defining features of the cloud are that you pay only for the resources you requisition and that you can easily and quickly add and release resources (elasticity). Together, these features allow you to create systems that have the capacity to handle your workload, and you donâ€™t pay for any excess capacity. Elasticity applies at different time scales. Some systems see relatively stable workloads, in which case you might consider manually reviewing and changing resource allocation on a monthly or quarterly time scale to match this slowly changing workload. Other systems see more dynamic workloads with rapid increases and decreases in the rate of requests, and so need a way to automate adding and releasing service instances.
