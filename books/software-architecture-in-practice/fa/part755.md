As shown in [Figure 22.2](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig02), objects (i.e., element instances) have a lifeline, drawn as a vertical dashed line down the time axis. The sequence is usually started by an actor on the far left. The instances interact by sending messages, which are shown as horizontal arrows. A message can be a message sent over a network, a function call, or an event sent through a queue. The message usually maps to a resource (operation) in the interface of the receiver instance. A filled arrowhead on a solid line represents a synchronous message, whereas an open arrowhead represents an asynchronous message. The dashed arrow is a return message. The execution occurrence bars along the lifeline indicate that the instance is processing or blocked waiting for a return. *  A UML communication diagram shows a graph of interacting elements and annotates each interaction with a number denoting its order. Similar to sequence diagrams, instances shown in a communication diagram are elements described in the accompanying structural documentation. Communication diagrams are useful when the task is to verify that an architecture can fulfill the functional requirements. Such diagrams are not useful when understanding of concurrent actions is important, as when conducting a performance analysis.
