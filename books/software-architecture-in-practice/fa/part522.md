1.  Create a container image containing a Linux distribution. (This image can be downloaded from a library using a container management system.) 2.  Once you create the image and identify it as an image, execute it (i.e., instantiate it). 3.  Use that container to load services—Apache, in our example, using features of Linux. 4.  Exit the container and inform the container management system that this is a second image. 5.  Execute this second image and load MySQL. 6.  Exit the container and give this third image a name. 7.  Repeat this process one more time and load PHP. Now you have a fourth container image; this one holds the entire LAMP stack. Because this image was created in steps and you told the container management system to make each step an image, the container management system considers the final image to be made up of “layers.”
