This chapter’s “For Further Reading” section contains a reference that describes PALM, and business goal scenarios, in full detail. *  Identify potential QAs from business goals. For each important business goal scenario, have the participants describe a QA and response measure value that (if architected into the system) would help achieve the goal. The process of capturing business goals is well served by having a set of candidate business goals handy to use as conversation-starters. If you know that many businesses want to gain market share, for instance, you can use that motivation to engage the right stakeholders in your organization: “What are our ambitions about market share for this product, and how could the architecture contribute to meeting them?” Our research in business goals has led us to adopt the categories shown in the list that follows. These categories can be used as an aid to brainstorming and elicitation. By employing the list of categories, and asking the stakeholders about possible business goals in each category, some assurance of coverage is gained.
