#### Establishing Relationships between the Elements The creation of structures also requires making decisions with respect to the relationships that exist between the elements and their properties. Consider again the client-server pattern. In instantiating this pattern, you need to decide which clients will talk to which servers, via which ports and protocols. You also need to decide whether communication will be synchronous or asynchronous. Who initiates interactions? How much information is transferred and at what rate? These design decisions can have a significant impact with respect to achieving QAs such as performance. #### Defining Interfaces Interfaces establish a contractual specification that allows elements to collaborate and exchange information. They may be either external or internal. External interfaces are interfaces of other systems with which your system must interact. These may form constraints for your system, since you usually cannot influence their specification. As we noted earlier, establishing a system context at the beginning of the design process is useful to identify external interfaces. Since external entities and the system under development interact via interfaces, there should be at least one external interface per external system (as shown in [Figure 20.2](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig02)).
