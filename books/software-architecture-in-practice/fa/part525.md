Container instances share an operating system. The operating system must be compatible with the container runtime engine, which limits the software that can run on a container. The container runtime engine starts, monitors, and restarts the service running in a container. This engine typically starts and monitors just one program in a container instance. If that one program completes and exits normally, execution of that container ends. For this reason, containers generally run a single service (although that service can be multi-threaded). Furthermore, one benefit of using containers is that the size of the container image is small, including only those programs and libraries necessary to support the service we want to run. Multiple services in a container could bloat the image size, increasing the container startup time and runtime memory footprint. As we will see shortly, we can group container instances running related services so that they will execute on the same physical machine and can communicate efficiently. Some container runtime engines even allow containers within a group to share memory and coordination mechanisms such as semaphores.
