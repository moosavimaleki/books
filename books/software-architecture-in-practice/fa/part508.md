Historically, as applications grew, all the code and data would not fit into physical memory. Virtual memory technology was developed to deal with this challenge. Memory management hardware partitions a processâ€™s address space into pages, and swaps pages between physical memory and secondary storage as needed. The pages that are in physical memory can be accessed immediately, and other pages are stored on the secondary memory until they are needed. The hardware supports the isolation of one address space from another. Disk sharing and isolation are achieved using several mechanisms. First, the physical disks can be accessed only through a disk controller that ensures the data streams to and from each thread are delivered in sequence. Also, the operating system may tag executing threads and disk content such as files and directories with information such as a user ID and group, and restrict visibility or access by comparing the tags of the thread requesting access and the disk content.
