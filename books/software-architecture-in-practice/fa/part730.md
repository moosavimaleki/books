Because different views support different goals and uses, we do not advocate using any particular view or collection of views. The views you should document depend on the uses you expect to make of the documentation. Different views will highlight different system elements and relations. How many different views to represent is the result of a cost/benefit decision. Each view has a cost and a benefit, and you should ensure that the expected benefits of creating and maintaining a particular view outweigh its costs. The choice of views is driven by the need to document a particular pattern in your design. Some patterns are composed of modules, others consist of components and connectors, and still others have deployment considerations. Module views, component-and-connector (C&C) views, and allocation views are the appropriate mechanism for representing these considerations, respectively. These categories of views correspond, of course, to the three categories of architectural structures described in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01). (Recall from [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01) that a structure is a collection of elements, relations, and properties, whereas a view is a representation of one or more architectural structures.)
