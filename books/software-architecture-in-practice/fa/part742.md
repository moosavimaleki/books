UML components are a good semantic match to C&C components because they permit intuitive documentation of important information such as interfaces, properties, and behavioral descriptions. UML components also distinguish between component types and component instances, which is useful when defining view-specific component types. #### Allocation Views Allocation views describe the mapping of software units to elements of an environment in which the software is developed or in which it executes. The environment in such a view varies; it might be the hardware, the operating environment in which the software is executed, the file systems supporting development or deployment, or the development organization(s). [Table 22.3](ch22.xhtml#ch22tab03) summarizes the characteristics of allocation views. These views consist of software elements and environmental elements. Examples of environmental elements are a processor, a disk farm, a file or folder, or a group of developers. The software elements come from a module or C&C view.
