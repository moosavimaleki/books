*  Reference architectures. In the case of reference architectures, instantiation typically means that you perform some sort of customization. This will require you to add or remove elements that are part of the structure that is defined by the reference architecture. For example, if you are designing a web application that needs to communicate with an external application to handle payments, you will probably need to add an integration component alongside the traditional presentation, business, and data tiers. *  Patterns. Patterns provide a generic structure composed of elements, along with their relationships and their responsibilities. As this structure is generic, you will need to adapt it to your specific problem. Instantiation usually involves transforming the generic structure defined by the pattern into a specific one that is adapted to the needs of the problem you are solving. For example, consider the client-server architectural pattern. It establishes the basic elements of computation (i.e., clients and servers) and their relationships (i.e., connection and communication), but does not specify how many clients or servers you should use for your problem, or what the functionality of each should be, or which clients should talk to which servers, or which communication protocol they should use. Instantiation fills in these blanks.
