*  Implementation information. Modules are units of implementation. It is therefore useful to record information related to their implementation from the point of view of managing their development and building the system that contains them. This might include: Mapping to source code units. This identifies the files that constitute the implementation of a module. For example, a module Account, if implemented in Java, might have several files that constitute its implementation: IAccount.java (an interface), AccountImpl.java (implementation of Account functionality), and perhaps even a unit test AccountTest.java. Test information. The module’s test plan, test cases, test harness, and test data are important to document. This information may simply be a pointer to the location of these artifacts. Management information. A manager may need information about the module’s predicted schedule and budget. This information may simply be a pointer to the location of these artifacts. Implementation constraints. In many cases, the architect will have an implementation strategy in mind for a module or may know of constraints that the implementation must follow.
