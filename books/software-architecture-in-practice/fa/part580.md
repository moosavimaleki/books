*  Choosing the appropriate protocol dynamically. In the event that multiple protocols are simultaneously available, the system should choose a protocol dynamically based on factors such as cost, bandwidth, and power consumption. *  Modifiability. Given the large number of protocols and their rapid evolution, it is likely that over the lifetime of a mobile system, new or alternative protocols will need to be supported. The system should be designed to support changes or replacements in the elements of the system involved in communication. *  Bandwidth. The information to be communicated to other systems should be analyzed for distance, volume, and latency requirements so that appropriate architectural choices can be made. The protocols all vary in terms of those qualities. *  Intermittent/limited/no connectivity. Communication may be lost while the device is in motion (e.g., a smartphone going through a tunnel). The system should be designed so that data integrity is maintained in case of a loss of connectivity, and computation can be resumed without loss of consistency when connectivity returns. The system should be designed to deal gracefully with limited connectivity or even no connectivity. Degraded and fallback modes should be dynamically available to deal with such situations.
