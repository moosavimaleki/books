An element (component or connector) of a C&C view will have various properties associated with it. Specifically, every element should have a name and type, with its additional properties depending on the type of component or connector. As an architect, you should define values for the properties that support the intended analyses for the particular C&C view. The following are examples of some typical properties and their uses: *  Reliability. What is the likelihood of failure for a given component or connector? This property might be used to help determine overall system availability. *  Performance. What kinds of response time will the component provide under what loads? What kind of bandwidth, latency, or jitter can be expected for a given connector? This property can be used with others to determine system-wide properties such as response times, throughput, and buffering needs. *  Resource requirements. What are the processing and storage needs of a component or a connector? If relevant, how much energy does it consume? This property can be used to determine whether a proposed hardware configuration will be adequate.
