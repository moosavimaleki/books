*  C&C views with each other. Because all C&C views show runtime relations among components and connectors of various types, they tend to combine well. Different (separate) C&C views tend to show different parts of the system, or tend to show decomposition refinements of components in other views. The result is often a set of views that can be combined easily. *  Deployment view with any C&C view that shows processes. Processes are the components that are deployed onto processors, virtual machines, or containers. Thus there is a strong association between the elements in these views. *  Decomposition view and any work assignment, implementation, uses, or layered views. The decomposed modules form the units of work, development, and uses. In addition, these modules populate layers. [Figure 22.1](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig01) shows an example of a combined view that is an overlay of client-server, multi-tier, and deployment views. ![An illustration of client-server, multi-tier, and deployment views.](graphics/22fig01.jpg)
