The process that we advocate requires three types of information: *  Source code. This is used to determine structural dependencies. *  Revision history, as extracted from a project’s version control system. This is used to determine the co-evolution of code units. *  Issue information, as extracted from an issue control system. This is used to determine the reason for changes. The model for analyzing debt identifies areas of the architecture that are experiencing unusually high rates of bugs and churn (committed lines of code) and attempts to associate these symptoms with design flaws. ### 23.1 Determining Whether You Have an Architecture Debt Problem In our process for managing architecture debt, we will focus on the physical manifestation of architectural elements, which means the files in which their source code is stored. How do we determine if a group of files is architecturally connected? One way is to identify the static dependencies between the files in your project—this method calls that method, for example. You can find these by employing a static code analysis tool. A second approach is to capture the evolutionary dependencies between files in a project. An evolutionary dependency occurs when two files change together, and you can extract this information from your revision control system.
