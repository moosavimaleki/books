### 18.2 Network Connectivity In this section, we focus on the architectural concerns most relevant to network connectivity of mobile systems. We will focus on wireless communication between the mobile platform and the outside world. The network might be used to control the device or to send and receive information. Wireless networks are categorized based on the distance over which they operate. *  Within 4 centimeters. Near Field Communication (NFC) is used for keycards and contactless payment systems. Standards in this area are being developed by the GSM Alliance. *  Within 10 meters. The IEEE 802.15 family of standards covers this distance. Bluetooth and Zigbee are common protocols within this category. *  Within 100 meters. The IEEE 802.11 family of standards (Wi-Fi) is used within this distance. *  Within several kilometers. The IEEE 802.16 standards cover this distance. WiMAX is the commercial name for the IEEE 802.16 standards. *  More than several kilometers. This is achieved by cellular or satellite communication.
