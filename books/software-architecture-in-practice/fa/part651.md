You also need to keep in mind that the decisions regarding the selection of design concepts that you made in previous iterations may restrict the design concepts that you can now select due to incompatibilities. An example would be selecting a web architecture in an initial iteration and then selecting a user interface framework for local applications in a subsequent iteration. #### Creation of Prototypes In case the previously mentioned analysis techniques do not guide you to make an appropriate selection of design concepts, you may need to create prototypes and collect measurements from them. Creating early “throwaway” prototypes is a useful technique to help in the selection of externally developed components. This type of prototype is usually created without consideration for maintainability, reuse, or allowance for achieving other important goals. Such a prototype should not be used as a basis for further development. Although the creation of prototypes can be costly, certain scenarios strongly motivate them. When thinking about whether you should create a prototype, ask these questions:
