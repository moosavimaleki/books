*  Local knowledge of markets. Developers who are developing variants of a system to be sold in their market have more knowledge about the types of features that are appropriate and the types of cultural issues that may arise. How does distributed development play out on a project? Assume Module A uses an interface from Module B. In time, as circumstances change, this interface may need to be modified. In consequence, the team responsible for Module B must coordinate with the team responsible for Module A, as indicated in [Figure 24.2](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig02). This kind of coordination is easy if it involves a short conversation at the shared vending machines, but itâ€™s not so easy if it involves a preplanned web conference at a time when it is the middle of the night for one of the teams. ![An illustration of the coordination and dependency between teams.](graphics/24fig02.jpg) Figure 24.2 Coordination between teams and modules
