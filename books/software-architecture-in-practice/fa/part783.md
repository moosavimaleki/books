There are other practical considerations for creating, maintaining, and distributing the documentation, such as choosing a release strategy, choosing a dissemination tool such as a wiki, and creating documentation for architectures that change dynamically. ### 22.11 For Further Reading Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond [[Clements 10a](ref01.xhtml#ref_63)] is a comprehensive treatment of the architecture documentation approach described in this chapter. It details a multitude of different views and notations for them. It also describes how to package the documentation into a coherent whole. Appendix A covers using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document architecture and architectural information. ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 (“eye-so-forty-two-oh-ten” for short) is the ISO (and IEEE) standard, Systems and Software Engineering: Architecture Description. This standard centers on two key ideas: a conceptual framework for architecture description and a statement of which information must be found in any ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010-compliant architecture description, using multiple viewpoints driven by stakeholders’ concerns.
