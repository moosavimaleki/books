Having two or more devices agree on what time it is can be even more challenging. The clock readings from two different devices on a network will be different. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize time across different devices that are connected over a local or wide area network. It involves exchanging messages between a time server and client devices to estimate the network latency, and then applying algorithms to synchronize a client device’s clock to the time server. NTP is accurate to around 1 millisecond on local area networks and around 10 milliseconds on public networks. Congestion can cause errors of 100 milliseconds or more. Cloud service providers provide very precise time references for their time servers. For example, Amazon and Google use atomic clocks, which have virtually unmeasurable drift. Both can therefore provide an extremely accurate answer to the question, “What time is it?” Of course, what time it is when you get the answer is another matter.
