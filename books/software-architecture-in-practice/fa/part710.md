It turned out that this project manager knew how to manipulate events and people in ways that would have impressed Machiavelli. The architect’s departure was not because of the reorganization, but merely coincident with it. The project manager had orchestrated it. The architect had, the manager felt, become too autocratic and dictatorial, and the manager wanted the junior design staff to be given the opportunity to mature and contribute. The architect’s mid-exercise departure was exactly what the project manager had wanted. And the design team’s emergence under fire had been the primary purpose of the evaluation exercise all along. Although we found several important issues related to the architecture, the project manager knew about every one of them before we ever arrived. In fact, he made sure we uncovered some of them by making a few discreet remarks during breaks or after a day’s session. Was this exercise a success? The client could not have been more pleased. His instincts about the architecture’s strengths and weaknesses were confirmed. We were instrumental in helping his design team, which would guide the system through the stormy seas of the company’s reorganization, come together as an effective and cohesive unit at exactly the right time. And the client was so pleased with our final report that he made sure the company’s board of directors saw it.
