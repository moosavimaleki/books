In short, the Agile Manifesto makes a pretty lousy prenup agreement for any marriage between Agile and architecture. However, accompanying the Manifesto are 12 Agile principles that, if read charitably, hint at a middle ground between the two camps. [Table 24.2](ch24.xhtml#ch24tab02) lists these principles and provides architecture-centric commentary on each one. Table 24.2 Agile Principles and Architecture-centric Perspective Agile Principle Architecture-centric View Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Absolutely. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. Absolutely. This principle is served by architectures that provide high degrees of modifiability ([Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08)) and deployability ([Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05)). Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter time scale. Absolutely, as long as this principle is not seen as precluding a thoughtful architecture. DevOps has a large role to play here, and we have seen, in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05), how architectures can support DevOps.
