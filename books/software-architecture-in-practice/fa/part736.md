*  Revision history. Knowing the history of a module, including its authors and particular changes, may help you when you’re performing maintenance activities. A module view can be used to explain the system’s functionality to someone not familiar with it. The various levels of granularity of the module decomposition provide a top-down presentation of the system’s responsibilities and, therefore, can guide the learning process. For a system whose implementation is already in place, module views, if kept up-to-date, are helpful because they explain the structure of the code base to a new developer on the team. Conversely, it is difficult to use the module views to make inferences about runtime behavior, because these views are just a static partition of the functions of the software. Thus a module view is not typically used for analysis of performance, reliability, and many other runtime qualities. For those purposes, we rely on component-and-connector and allocation views.
