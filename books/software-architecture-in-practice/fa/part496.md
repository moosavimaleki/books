*  Incorrect, invalid, or illegal information was sent to the interface—for example, calling an operation with a null value parameter that should not be null. Associating an error condition with the resource is the prudent thing to do. *  The element is in the wrong state for handling the request. The element may have entered the improper state as a result of a previous action or the lack of a previous action on the part of the same or another actor. Examples of the latter include invoking an operation or reading a property before the element’s initialization has completed, and writing to a storage device that has been taken offline by the system’s human operator. *  A hardware or software error occurred that prevented the element from successfully executing. Processor failures, failure of the network to respond, and inability to allocate more memory are examples of this kind of error condition.
