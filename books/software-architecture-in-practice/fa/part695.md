Recall that the utility tree is constructed by the architect and the project decision makers. Together, they determine the importance of each scenario: The architect rates the technical difficulty or risk of the scenario (on a H, M, L scale), and the project decision makers rate its business importance. ##### Step 6: Analyze the Architectural Approaches The evaluation team examines the highest-ranked scenarios (as identified in the utility tree) one at a time; the architect is asked to explain how the architecture supports each one. Evaluation team members—especially the questioners—probe for the architectural approaches that the architect used to carry out the scenario. Along the way, the evaluation team documents the relevant architectural decisions and identifies and catalogs their risks, non-risks, and tradeoffs. For well-known approaches, the evaluation team asks how the architect overcame known weaknesses in the approach or how the architect gained assurance that the approach sufficed. The goal is for the evaluation team to be convinced that the instantiation of the approach is appropriate for meeting the attribute-specific requirements for which it is intended.
