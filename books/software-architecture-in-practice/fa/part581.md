*  Security. Mobile devices are particularly vulnerable to spoofing, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle attacks, so responding to such attacks should be part of the architect’s concerns. ### 18.3 Sensors and Actuators A sensor is a device that detects the physical characteristics of its environment and translates those characteristics into an electronic representation. A mobile device gathers environmental data either to guide its own operation (such as the altimeter in a drone), or to report that data back to a user (such as the magnetic compass in your smartphone). A transducer senses external electronic impulses and converts them into a more usable internal form. In this section. we will use the term “sensor” to encompass transducers as well, and assume the electronic representation is digital. A sensor hub is a coprocessor that helps integrate data from different sensors and process it. A sensor hub can help offload these jobs from a product’s main CPU, thereby saving battery consumption and improving performance.
