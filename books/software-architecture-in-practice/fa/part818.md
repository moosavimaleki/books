Not surprisingly, the approach we recommend lies in between these two extremes: It’s the “Iteration 0” approach, shown in [Figure 24.1(c)](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig01). In projects where you have some understanding of the requirements, you should consider beginning by performing a few iterations of attribute-driven design (ADD; described in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20)). These design iterations can focus on choosing the major architectural patterns (including a reference architecture, if one is appropriate), frameworks, and components. Aim for support of the project’s increments in a way that helps the architecture’s stakeholders, as recommended in [Section 24.2](ch24.xhtml#ch24lev1sec2). Early on, this will help you structure the project, define work assignments and team formation, and address the most critical quality attributes. If and when requirements change—particularly if these are driving quality attribute requirements—adopt a practice of Agile experimentation, where spikes are used to address new requirements. A spike is a time-boxed task that is created to answer a technical question or gather information; it is not intended to lead to a finished product. Spikes are developed in a separate code branch and, if successful, merged into the main branch of the code. In this way, emerging requirements can be taken in stride and managed without being too disruptive to the overall process of development.
