A load balancer solves the following problem: There is a single instance of a service running on a VM or in a container, and too many requests are arriving at this instance for it to provide acceptable latency. One solution is to have multiple instances of the service and distribute the requests among them. The distribution mechanism in such a case is a separate serviceâ€”the load balancer. [Figure 17.4](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig04) shows a load balancer distributing requests between two VM (service) instances. The same discussion would apply if there were two container instances. (Containers were discussed in [Chapter 16](ch16.xhtml#ch16).) ![An illustration shows a distribution of requests from clients to service instances.](graphics/17fig04.jpg) Figure 17.4 A load balancer distributing requests from two clients to two service instances A figure displays the distribution of requests of clients through a load balancer. Two client systems are shown on the top. A load balancer system is shown at the bottom center. The requests from the two clients the load balancer. Two service instance systems are shown at the bottom. The load balancer distributes the requests to the two service instances.
