The matrix shown in [Figure 23.1](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig01) is quite sparse. It means that these files are not heavily structurally coupled to each other and, as a consequence, you might expect that it would be relatively easy to change these files independently. In other words, this system seems to have relatively little architecture debt. Now consider [Figure 23.2](ch23.xhtml#ch23fig02), which overlays historical co-change information on FigureÂ 23.1. Historical co-change information is extracted from the version control system. This indicates how often two files change together in commits. ![The evolutionary dependencies of the Apache Camel are presented.](graphics/23fig02.jpg) Figure 23.2 A DSM Apache Camel overlaying evolutionary dependencies An illustration shows the DSM of Apache camel that shows the overlaying evolutionary dependencies. A 32 by 32 matrix is displayed. The rows of the matrix represent different java extension files. The column represents the numbers from 1 to 32. The diagonal of the matrix shows numbers from 1 to 32 along with the dependencies. Wherever the dependencies exist, it is marked as dp and marked with numbers in the matrix.
