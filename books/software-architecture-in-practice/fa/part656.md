*  Allocation structures, which are composed of both software elements (from a module or C&C structure) and non-software elements that may exist both at development and at runtime, such as file systems, hardware, and development teams When you instantiate a design concept, you may actually affect more than one structure. For example, in a particular iteration, you might instantiate the passive redundancy (warm spare) pattern, introduced in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04). This will result in both a C&C structure and an allocation structure. As part of applying this pattern, you will need to choose the number of spares, the degree to which the state of the spares is kept consistent with that of the active node, a mechanism for managing and transferring state, and a mechanism for detecting the failure of a node. These decisions are responsibilities that must live somewhere in the elements of a module structure. #### Instantiating Elements Hereâ€™s how instantiation might look for each of the design concept categories:
