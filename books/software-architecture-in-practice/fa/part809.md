## 24 The Role of Architects in Projects I don’t know why people hire architects and then tell them what to do. —Frank Gehry Any practice of architecture performed outside of a classroom takes place in the larger context of a development project, which is planned and carried out by people working in one or more organizations. Architecture, for all its importance, is only the means toward a larger end.
