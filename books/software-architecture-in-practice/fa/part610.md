*  Most of the information found in a requirements specification does not affect the architecture. As we’ve seen over and over, architectures are mostly driven or “shaped” by QA requirements, which determine and constrain the most important architectural decisions. Even so, the vast bulk of most requirements specifications focus on the required features and functionality of a system, which shape the architecture the least. The best software engineering practices do prescribe capturing QA requirements. For example, the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) says that QA requirements are like any other requirements: They must be captured if they are important, and they should be specified unambiguously and be testable. In practice, though, we rarely see adequate capture of QA requirements. How many times have you seen a requirement of the form “The system shall be modular” or “The system shall exhibit high usability” or “The system shall meet users’ performance expectations”? These are not useful requirements because they are not testable; they are not falsifiable. But, looking on the bright side, they can be viewed as invitations for the architect to begin a conversation about what the requirements in these areas really are.
