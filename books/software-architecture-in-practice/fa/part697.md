The analysis during step 6 is not meant to be comprehensive. The key is to elicit sufficient architectural information to establish some link between the architectural decisions that have been made and the quality attribute requirements that need to be satisfied. [Figure 21.1](ch21.xhtml#ch21fig01) shows a template for capturing the analysis of an architectural approach for a scenario. As shown in the figure, based on the results of this step, the evaluation team can identify and record a set of risks and non-risks, sensitivity points, and tradeoffs. ![An illustration of an architecture approach analysis.](graphics/21fig01.jpg) Figure 21.1 Example of architecture approach analysis (adapted from [[Clements 01b](ref01.xhtml#ref_61)]) The figure of the architecture approach analysis is presented. The scenario to detect and recover from the HW failure of the main switch is shown. The attributes, environment, stimulus, and response are listed. The architectural decision, sensitivity, tradeoff, risk, and non-risk are displayed. The architecture diagram is shown at the bottom. The primary CPU is shown at the top. The backup CPU with a watchdog is shown at the bottom. The heartbeat of one second is sent from primary to backup CPU. These two CPUs are connected with the switch CPU at the right.
