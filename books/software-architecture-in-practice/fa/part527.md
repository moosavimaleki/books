This means that you can develop a container on your development computer, deploy it to a production computer, and have it execute there. Of course, the resources available will be different in each case, so deployment is still not trivial. If you specify all the resources as configuration parameters, the movement of your container into production is simplified. ### 16.7 Pods Kubernetes is open source orchestration software for deploying, managing, and scaling containers. It has one more element in its hierarchy: Pods. A Pod is a group of related containers. In Kubernetes, nodes (hardware or VMs) contain Pods, and Pods contain containers, as shown in [Figure 16.4](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig04). The containers in a Pod share an IP address and port space to receive requests from other services. They can communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms such as semaphores or shared memory, and they can share ephemeral storage volumes that exist for the lifetime of the Pod. They have the same lifetimeâ€”the containers in Pods are allocated and deallocated together. For example, service meshes, discussed in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), are often packaged as a Pod.
