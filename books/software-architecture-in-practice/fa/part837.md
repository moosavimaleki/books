Gain experience carrying out the duties. Apprenticeship is a productive path to achieving experience. Education alone is not enough, because education without on-the-job application merely enhances knowledge. 2.  Improve your nontechnical skills. This dimension of improvement involves taking professional development courses, for example, in leadership or time management. Some people will never become truly great leaders or communicators, but we can all improve on these skills. 3.  Master the body of knowledge. One of the most important things a competent architect must do is master the body of knowledge and remain up-to-date on it. To emphasize the importance of keeping current with the field, consider the advances in knowledge required for architects that have emerged in just the last few years. For example, architectures to support computing in the cloud ([Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17)) were not important several years ago. Taking courses, becoming certified, reading books and journals, visiting websites, reading blogs, attending architecture-oriented conferences, joining professional societies, and meeting with other architects are all useful ways to improve knowledge.
