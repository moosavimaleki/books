Common practice is to design and implement services to be stateless. Stateful services lose their history if they fail, and recovering that state can be difficult. Also, as we will see in the next section, new service instances may be created, and designing services to be stateless allows a new service instance to process a client request and produce the same response as any other service instance. In some cases, it may be difficult or inefficient to design a service to be stateless, so we might want a series of messages from a client to be processed by the same service instance. We can accomplish this by having the first request in the series be handled by the load balancer and distributed to a service instance, and then allowing the client to establish a session directly with that service instance and subsequent requests to bypass the Load balancer. Alternatively, some load balancers can be configured to treat certain types of requests as sticky, which causes the load balancer to send subsequent requests from a client to the same service instance that handled the last message from this client. These approaches—direct sessions and sticky messages—should be used only under special circumstances because of the possibility of failure of the instance and the risk that the instance to which the messages are sticking may become overloaded.
