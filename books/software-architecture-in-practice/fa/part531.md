### 16.9 Summary Virtualization has been a boon for software and system architects, as it provides efficient, cost-effective allocation platforms for networked (typically web-based) services. Hardware virtualization allows for the creation of several virtual machines that share the same physical machine. It does this while enforcing isolation of the CPU, memory, disk storage, and network. Consequently, the resources of the physical machine can be shared among several VMs, while the number of physical machines that an organization must purchase or rent is minimized. A VM image is the set of bits that are loaded into a VM to enable its execution. VM images can be created by various techniques for provisioning, including using operating system functions or loading a pre-created image. Containers are a packaging mechanism that virtualizes the operating system. A container can be moved from one environment to another if a compatible container runtime engine is available. The interface to container runtime engines has been standardized.
