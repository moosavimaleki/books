2.  Separation of concerns. Virtualization allows an architect to treat runtime resources as commodities, deferring provisioning and deployment decisions to another person or organization. ### 16.3 VM Images We call the contents of the disk storage that we boot a VM from a VM image. This image contains the bits that represent the instructions and data that make up the software that we will run (i.e., the operating system and services). The bits are organized into files and directories according to the file system used by your operating system. The image also contains the boot load program, stored in its predetermined location. There are three approaches you can follow to create a new VM image: 1.  You can find a machine that is already running the software you want and make a snapshot copy of the bits in that machineâ€™s memory. 2.  You can start from an existing image and add additional software.
