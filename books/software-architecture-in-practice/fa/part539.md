Choosing the cloud region that your service will run on is an important design decision. When you ask to be provided with a new virtual machine (VM) that runs in the cloud, you may specify which region the VM will run on. Sometimes the availability zone may be chosen automatically, but you often will want to choose the zone yourself, for availability and business continuity reasons. All access to a public cloud occurs over the Internet. There are two main gateways into a cloud: a management gateway and a message gateway ([Figure 17.2](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig02)). Here we will focus on the management gateway; we discussed message gateways in [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15). ![An illustration of gateways to a public cloud.](graphics/17fig02.jpg) Figure 17.2 Gateways into a public cloud A figure depicts the gateways of a public cloud. A screenshot of the management UI is displayed on the top left. A client system is shown at the bottom left. The management UI interacts with the management gateway of the public cloud on the right. The client system interacts with the message gateway of the public cloud on the right.
