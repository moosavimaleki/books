Another kind of view, which we call a quality view, can be tailored for specific stakeholders or to address specific concerns. Quality views are formed by extracting the relevant pieces of structural views and packaging them together. Here are five examples: *  A security view can show all of the architectural measures taken to provide security. It would depict the components that have some security role or responsibility, how those components communicate, any data repositories for security information, and repositories that are of security interest. The view’s properties would include other security measures (e.g., physical security) in the system’s environment. The security view would also show the operation of security protocols and where and how humans interact with the security elements. Finally, it would capture how the system responds to specific threats and vulnerabilities. *  A communications view might be especially helpful for systems that are globally dispersed and heterogeneous. This view would show all of the component-to-component channels, various network channels, quality-of-service parameter values, and areas of concurrency. Such a view can be used to analyze certain kinds of performance and reliability, such as deadlock or race condition detection. In addition, it could show (for example) how network bandwidth is dynamically allocated.
