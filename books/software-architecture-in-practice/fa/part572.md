2.  Network connectivity. Mobile systems tend to deliver much of their functionality by exchanging information with other devices while they are in motion. They must therefore connect to those devices, but their mobility makes these connections tricky. 3.  Sensors and actuators. Mobile systems tend to gain more information from sensors than fixed systems do, and they often use actuators to interact with their environment. 4.  Resources. Mobile systems tend to be more resource-constrained than fixed systems. For one thing, they are often quite small, such that physical packaging becomes a limiting factor. For another, their mobility often makes weight a factor. Mobile devices that must be small and lightweight have limits on the resources they can provide. 5.  Life cycle. Testing mobile systems differs from the testing of other systems. Deploying new versions also introduces some special issues. When designing a system for a mobile platform, you must deal with a large number of domain-specific requirements. Self-driving automobiles and autonomous drones must be safe; smartphones must provide an open platform for a variety of vastly different applications; entertainment systems must work with a wide range of content formats and service providers. In this chapter, weâ€™ll focus on the characteristics shared by many (if not all) mobile systems that an architect must consider when designing a system.
