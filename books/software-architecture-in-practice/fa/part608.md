You cannot hope to design a successful architecture if you do not know the ASRs. ASRs often, but not always, take the form of quality attribute (QA) requirements—the performance, security, modifiability, availability, usability, and so forth, that the architecture must provide to the system. In [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[14](ch14.xhtml#ch14), we introduced patterns and tactics to achieve QAs. Each time you select a pattern or tactic to use in your architecture, you are doing so because of the need to meet QA requirements. The more difficult and important the QA requirement, the more likely it is to significantly affect the architecture, and hence to be an ASR. Architects must identify ASRs, usually after doing a significant bit of work to uncover candidate ASRs. Competent architects know this. Indeed, as we observe experienced architects going about their duties, we notice that the first thing they do is start talking to the important stakeholders. They’re gathering the information they need to produce the architecture that will respond to the project’s needs—whether or not this information has been previously identified.
