### 18.4 Resources In this section, we discuss computing resources from the perspective of their physical characteristics. For example, in devices where energy comes from batteries, we need to be concerned with battery volume, weight, and thermal properties. The same holds true for resources such as networks, processors, and sensors. The tradeoff in the choice of resources is between the contribution of the particular resource under consideration and its volume, weight, and cost. Cost is always a factor. Costs include both the manufacturing costs and nonrecurring engineering costs. Many mobile systems are manufactured by the millions and are highly price-sensitive. Thus a small difference in the price of a processor multiplied by the millions of copies of the system in which that processor is embedded can make a significant difference to the profitability of the organization producing the system. Volume discounts and reuse of hardware across different products are techniques that device vendors use to reduce costs.
