Working software is the primary measure of progress. Yes, as long as “primary” is not taken to mean “only,” and as long as this principle is not used as an excuse to eliminate all work except coding. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Absolutely. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Absolutely. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. Yes, of course, as long as it is understood that the work we are not doing can actually be jettisoned safely without detriment to the system being delivered. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. No, they don’t. The best architectures are consciously designed by skilled, talented, trained, and experienced architects, as we describe in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20) At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
