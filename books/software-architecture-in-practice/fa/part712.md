Third, the methods are constructed to establish and maintain a steady consensus throughout the exercise. There are no surprises at the end. The participants lay down the ground rules for what constitutes a suitable architecture, and they contribute to the risks uncovered at every step of the way. So: Do the best job you can. Be honest. Trust the methods. Trust in the goodwill and good intentions of the people you have assembled. And it will be okay. —PCC (Adapted from [[Clements 01b](ref01.xhtml#ref_61)]) ### 21.6 Lightweight Architecture Evaluation The Lightweight Architecture Evaluation (LAE) method is intended to be used in a project-internal context where the reviewing is carried out by peers on a regular basis. It uses the same concepts as the ATAM and is meant to be performed regularly. An LAE session may be convened to focus on what has changed since the prior review—in the architecture or in the architecture drivers—or to examine a previously unexamined portion of the architecture. Because of this limited scope, many of the ATAM’s steps can be omitted or shortened.
