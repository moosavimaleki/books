*  A module “uses” structure. This will allow increments to be planned, which is critical in any project that hopes to release its software incrementally. As we said in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01), the uses structure is used to engineer systems that can be extended to add functionality, or from which useful functional subsets can be extracted. Trying to create a system that purposefully supports incremental development is problematic if you don’t plan what exactly the increments will be. *  Whichever component-and-connector (C&C) structure(s) best convey the overall solution approach. *  A broad-brush deployment structure that at least addresses major questions such as whether the system will be deployed on mobile devices, on a cloud infrastructure, and so forth. After that, use the needs of the architecture’s stakeholders as a guide when crafting the contents of subsequent releases. #### Recommendations to the Architect First and foremost, make sure you know who your stakeholders are and what their needs are, so that you can design appropriate solutions and documentation. Moreover:
