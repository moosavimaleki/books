Once the ASRs are recorded as scenarios and placed at the leaves of the tree, you can evaluate these scenarios against two criteria: the business value of the candidate scenario and the technical risk of achieving it. You can use any scale you like, but we find that a simple “H” (high), “M” (medium), and “L” (low) scoring system suffices for each criterion. For business value, “high” designates a must-have requirement, “medium” identifies a requirement that is important but would not lead to project failure were it omitted, and “low” describes a nice requirement to meet but not something worth much effort. For technical risk, “high” means that meeting this ASR is keeping you awake at night, “medium” means meeting this ASR is concerning but does not carry a high risk, and “low” means that you have confidence in your ability to meet this ASR. [Table 19.1](ch19.xhtml#ch19tab01) shows a portion of an example utility tree. Each ASR is labeled with an indicator of its business value and its technical risk.
