![An activity diagram is presented.](graphics/22fig03.jpg) Figure 22.3 Activity diagram A sample activity diagram is depicted. Three columns such as depth meter, dive tracker, and thermometer. After the start of the activity, the read pressure block is shown. If the decision is underwater, control is passed to enter dive mode in the dive tracker column. If the decision is not underwater, control is sent back to read pressure. The control from the enter dive mode is divided into check depth and check the water temperature in the dive tracker column. After check depth, then control passes to read pressure in the depth meter column. If the decision is ascending too fast, then control passes to beep alarm in the dive tracker column. If the decision is not ascending too fast, check for underwater, If the decision is underwater, control goes to sleep 0.5 seconds in the dive tracker column. If the decision is not underwater, control passes to exit dive mode in the dive tracker column. Then, check the water temperature, then control passes to read water temperature in the thermometer column and then to sleep 30 seconds in the dive tracker column. Finally the exit dive mode. After the exit dive mode, control passes to finish dive mode and the activity comes to end.
