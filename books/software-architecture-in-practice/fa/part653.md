For example, suppose a team needs to decide whether the system they are designing should be based on a traditional three-tier architecture or should be composed of microservices. Since it is the teamâ€™s first project with microservices, they are not confident about that approach. They do a cost estimation for the two alternatives, and project that the cost of developing the three-tier architecture would be $500,000 and that of developing the microservices would be $650,000. If, having developed the three-tier architecture, the team later concluded that the wrong architecture was chosen, the estimated refactoring cost would be $300,000. If the microservices architecture was the first one developed, and a later refactoring was needed, its estimated additional cost would be $100,000. What should the team do?
