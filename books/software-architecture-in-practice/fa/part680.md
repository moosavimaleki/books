### 21.3 Who Can Perform the Evaluation? Evaluators should be highly skilled in the domain and the various quality attributes for which the system is to be evaluated. Excellent organizational and facilitation skills are also a must for evaluators. #### Evaluation by the Architect Evaluation is done—implicitly or explicitly—every time the architect makes a key design decision to address an ASR or completes a design milestone. This evaluation involves deciding among the competing alternatives. Evaluation by the architect is an integral part of the process of architecture design, as we discussed in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20). #### Evaluation by Peer Review Architectural designs to address ASRs can be peer reviewed, just as code can be peer reviewed. There should be a fixed amount of time allocated for the peer review, typically several hours to half a day. If the designers are using the Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) process described in [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20), then a peer review can be done at the end of step 7 of each ADD iteration. Reviewers should also use the tactics-based questionnaires that we presented in [Chapters 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)–[13](ch13.xhtml#ch13).
