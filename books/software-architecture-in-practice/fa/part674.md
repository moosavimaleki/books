## 21 Evaluating an Architecture A doctor can bury his mistakes, but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. —Frank Lloyd Wright In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02), we said that one major reason architecture is important is that you can predict the quality attributes of any system derived from it, before you build the system, by examining its architecture. That’s a pretty good deal, if you think about it. And this is the chapter where that capability comes home. Architecture evaluation is the process of determining the degree to which an architecture is fit for the purpose for which it is intended. Architecture is such an important contributor to the success of a system and software engineering project that it makes sense to pause and make sure that the architecture you’re designing will be able to provide all that’s expected of it. That’s the role of evaluation, which is based on analyzing the alternatives. Fortunately, there are mature methods to analyze architectures that use many of the concepts and techniques you’ve already learned in this book.
