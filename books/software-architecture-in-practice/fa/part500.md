Describing an element’s interface means making statements about the element that other elements can depend on. Documenting an interface means that you have to describe which services and properties are parts of the contract—a step that represents a promise to actors that the element will, indeed, fulfill this contract. Every implementation of the element that does not violate the contract is a valid implementation. A distinction must be drawn between the interface of an element and the documentation of that interface. What you can observe about an element is part of its interface—how long an operation takes, for example. The documentation of the interface covers a subset of that behavior: It lays out what we want our actors to be able to depend on. “Hyrum’s law” ([www.hyrumslaw.com](http://www.hyrumslaw.com)) states: “With a sufficient number of users of an interface, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: All observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.” True enough. But, as we said earlier, an actor that depends on what you do not publish about an element’s interface does so at its own risk.
