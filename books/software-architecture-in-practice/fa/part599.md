The component reaches the end of its life before the overall system reaches its end. The end of life means support will be discontinued, which creates high risks in case of failures: There will be no trusted source from which to get answers or support with reasonable costs—that is, without having to dissect and reverse-engineer the component in question. Newer better technology has come out, prompting a hardware/software upgrade. An example is retrofitting a 2000s car with a smartphone-connected infotainment system instead of an old radio/CD player. Newer technology is available that adds functionality without replacing existing functionality. For example, suppose the 2000s-era car never had a radio/CD player at all, or lacked a backup camera. *  The component reaches the end of its life before the overall system reaches its end.
