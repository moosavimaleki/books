![The approaches of architectural design are presented.](graphics/24fig01.jpg) Figure 24.1 Three approaches to architectural design The BDUF, emergent, and iteration 0 approach are depicted. The horizontal axis of the graphs represents the design effort. The BDUF approach graph shows an open downward curve that decreases on the right side. The emergent approach graph shows a wave pattern. Vertical dashed lines are shown at each center point between the waves and marked as development cycles. The iteration 0 approach graph shows wave patterns. The wave pattern on the left is higher and decreases as the wave moves rightward. Vertical dashed lines are shown at each center point between the waves and marked as development cycles.
