### 24.2 Incremental Architecture and Stakeholders Agile methodologies are built on the pillar of incremental development, with each increment delivering value to the customer or user. We’ll discuss Agile and architecture in its own section, but even if your project is not an Agile one, you should still expect to develop and release your architecture in increments following a tempo that supports the project’s own test and release schedule. Incremental architecture, then, is about releasing the architecture in increments. Specifically, this means releasing architecture documentation (as described in [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22)) in increments. This, in turn, entails deciding which views to release (out of your planned set) and at which depth. Using the structures we outlined in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01), consider these as candidates for your first increment: *  A module decomposition structure. This will inform the team structure for the development project, allowing the project organization to emerge. Teams can be defined, staffed, budgeted, and trained. The team structure will be the basis of project planning and budgeting, so this technical structure defines the project’s management structure.
