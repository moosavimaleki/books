Global development creates a need for an explicit coordination strategy that is based on more formal strategies than are needed for co-located development. ### 24.6 For Further Reading Dan Paulish has written an excellent book on managing in an architecture-centric environment—Architecture-centric Software Project Management: A Practical Guide—and the material in this chapter about distributed development is adapted from his book [[Paulish 02](ref01.xhtml#ref_209)]. You can read about SAFe at [scaledagileframework.com](http://scaledagileframework.com). Before SAFe, some members of the Agile community had independently arrived at a medium-weight management process that advocates up-front architecture. See [[Coplein 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_70)] for a description of the role of architecture in agile projects. Basic concepts of project management are covered in the IEEE Guide, Adoption of the Project Management Institute (PMI) Standard: A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, sixth edition [[IEEE 17](ref01.xhtml#ref_121)]. Software architecture metrics often fall within an architect’s purview on a project. A paper by Coulin et al. provides a helpful overview of the literature on this subject and, along the way, categorizes the metrics themselves [[Coulin 19](ref01.xhtml#ref_71)].
