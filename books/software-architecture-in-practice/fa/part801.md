#### Identifying Hotspots During the period that we studied SS1, 2,756 issues were recorded in its Jira issue-tracker (1,079 of which were bugs) and 3,262 commits were recorded in the Git version control repository. We identified hotspots using the process just described. In the end, three clusters of architecturally related files were identified as containing the most harmful anti-patterns and hence the most debt in the project. The debt from these three clusters represented a total of 291 files, out of 797 files in the entire project, or a bit more than one-third of the project’s files. The number of defects associated with these three clusters covered 89 percent of the project’s total defects (265). The chief architect of the project agreed that these clusters were problematic but had difficulty explaining why. When presented with this analysis, he acknowledged that these were true design problems, violating multiple design rules. The architect then crafted a number of refactorings, focusing on remedying the flawed relations among the files identified in the hotspots. These refactorings were based on removing the anti-patterns in the hotspots, so the architect had a great deal of guidance in how to do this.
