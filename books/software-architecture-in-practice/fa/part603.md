Life-cycle issues include choice of hardware, testing, deploying updates, and logging. Testing of the user interface may be more complicated with mobile systems than with fixed systems. Likewise, deployment is more complicated because of bandwidth, safety considerations, and other issues. ### 18.7 For Further Reading The Battery University ([https://batteryuniversity.com/](https://batteryuniversity.com/)) has more materials than you care about on batteries of various types and their measurement.
