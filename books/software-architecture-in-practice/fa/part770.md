*  The general idea behind the system. Although that information lies in the realm of requirements rather than architecture, a top-level context diagram or system overview can go a long way toward providing the necessary information. *  Which elements the developer has been assigned for implementationâ€”that is, where functionality should be implemented. *  The details of the assigned element, including the data model with which it must operate. *  The elements with which the assigned part interfaces and what those interfaces are. *  The code assets that the developer can utilize. *  The constraints, such as quality attributes, legacy system interfaces, and budget (resource or fiscal), that must be met. A developer, then, is likely to want to see *  Module views. Decomposition, uses and/or layered, and generalization. *  Component-and-connector (C&C) views. Various, showing the component(s) the developer was assigned and the components they interact with. *  Allocation views. Deployment, implementation, and installation.
