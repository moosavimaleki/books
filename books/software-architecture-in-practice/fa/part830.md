### 24.5 Summary Software architects do their work in the context of a development project of some sort. As such, they need to understand their role and responsibilities from that perspective. The project manager and the software architect may be seen as occupying complementary roles: The manager runs the project from an administrative perspective, and the architect runs the project from a technical solution perspective. These two roles intersect in various ways, and the architect can support the manager to enhance the project’s chance of success. In a project, architectures do not spring fully formed from Zeus’s forehead, but rather are released in increments that are useful to stakeholders. Thus the architect needs to have a good understanding of the architecture’s stakeholders and their information needs. Agile methodologies focus on incremental development. Over time, architecture and Agile (although they got off to a rough start together) have become indispensable partners.
