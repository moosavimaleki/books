### 21.8 For Further Reading For a more comprehensive treatment of the ATAM, see [[Clements 01b](ref01.xhtml#ref_61)]. Multiple case studies of applying the ATAM are available. They can be found by going to [sei.cmu.edu/library](http://sei.cmu.edu/library) and searching for “ATAM case study.” Several lighter-weight architecture evaluation methods have been developed. They can be found in [[Bouwers 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_41)], [[Kanwal 10](ref01.xhtml#ref_132)], and [[Bachmann 11](ref01.xhtml#ref_11)]. Analyses of the kinds of insights derived from an ATAM can be found in [[Bass 07](ref01.xhtml#ref_14)] and [[Bellomo 15](ref01.xhtml#ref_25)]. ### 21.9 Discussion Questions 1. Think of a software system that you’re working on. Prepare a 30-minute presentation on the business goals for this system. 2. If you were going to evaluate the architecture for this system, who would you want to participate? What would be the stakeholder roles, and who could you get to represent those roles? 3. Calculate the cost of an ATAM-based evaluation for a large enterprise-scale system’s architecture. Assume a fully burdened labor rate of $250,000 per year for the participants. Assuming that an evaluation uncovers an architectural risk and mitigating this risk saves 10 percent of project costs, under what circumstances would this ATAM be a sensible choice for a project?
