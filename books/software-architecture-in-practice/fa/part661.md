Internal interfaces are interfaces between the elements that result from the instantiation of design concepts. To identify the relationships and the interface details, you need to understand how the elements interact with each other to support use cases or QA scenarios. As we said in [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15) in our discussion of software Interfaces, “interacts” means anything one element does that can impact the processing of another element. A particularly common type of interaction is the runtime exchange of information. Behavioral representations such as UML sequence diagrams, statecharts, and activity diagrams (see [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22)) allow you to model the information that is exchanged between elements during execution. This type of analysis is also useful to identify relationships between elements: If two elements need to exchange information directly or otherwise depend on each other, then a relationship between these elements exists. Any information that is exchanged becomes part of the specification of the interface.
