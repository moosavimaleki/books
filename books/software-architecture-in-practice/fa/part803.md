We calculate the cost of these debts in terms of the lines of code committed for bug fixes. This information can be retrieved from a project’s revision control and issue-tracking systems. For SS1, the debt calculations we made were as follows: 1.  The architect estimated the effort required to refactor the three hotspots as 14 person-months. 2.  We calculated the average bug fixes per file annually for the total project as 0.33. 3.  We calculated the average number of annual bug fixes for files in hotspots as 237.8. 4.  Based on these results, we estimated that the annual number of bug fixes for the files in the hotspots, after refactoring, would be 96. 5.  The difference between the actual churn associated with the hotspot files and the expected amount of churn after refactoring is the expected savings. The estimated annual savings for the refactored files (using company average productivity numbers) was 41.35 person-months. Considering the calculations in steps 1–5, we see that for a cost of 14 person-months, the project can expect to save more than 41 person-months annually.
