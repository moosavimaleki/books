We can represent the file dependencies using a special kind of adjacency matrix called a design structure matrix (DSM). While other representations are certainly possible, DSMs have been used in engineering design for decades and are currently supported by a number of industrial tools. In a DSM, entities of interest (in our case, files) are placed both on the rows of the matrix and, in the same order, on the columns. The cells of the matrix are annotated to indicate the type of dependency. We can annotate a DSM cell with information showing that the file on the row inherits from the file on the column, or that it calls the file on the column, or that it co-changes with the file on the column. The first two annotations are structural, whereas the third is an evolutionary (or history) dependency. To repeat: Each row in the DSM represents a file. Entries on a row show the dependencies that this file has on other files in the system. If the system has low coupling, you would expect the DSM to be sparse; that is, any given file will be dependent on a small number of other files. Furthermore, you would hope that the DSM is lower diagonal; that is, all entries appear below the diagonal. This means that a file depends only on lower-level files, not on higher-level ones, and that you have no cyclic dependencies in your system.
