After introductions and an overview of the workshop steps, the QAW involves the following elements: *  Business/mission presentation. The stakeholder representing the business concerns behind the system (typically a manager or management representative) spends about one hour presenting the system’s business context, broad functional requirements, constraints, and known QA requirements. The QAs that will be refined in later steps will be derived largely from the business/mission needs presented in this step. *  Architectural plan presentation. While a detailed system or software architecture might not exist, it is possible that broad system descriptions, context drawings, or other artifacts have been created that describe some of the system’s technical details. At this point in the workshop, the architect will present the system architectural plans as they stand. This lets stakeholders know the current architectural thinking, to the extent that it exists. *  Identification of architectural drivers. The facilitators will share their list of key architectural drivers that they assembled in the prior two steps, and ask the stakeholders for clarifications, additions, deletions, and corrections. The idea is to reach a consensus on a distilled list of architectural drivers that include overall requirements, business drivers, constraints, and quality attributes.
