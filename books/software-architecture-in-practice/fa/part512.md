[qemu.org](http://qemu.org) Hosted/Type 2 hypervisors and emulators allow a user to interact with the applications running inside the VM through the host machineâ€™s on-screen display, keyboard, and mouse/touchpad. Developers working on desktop applications or working on specialized devices, such as mobile platforms or devices for the Internet of Things, may use a hosted/Type 2 hypervisor and/or an emulator as part of their build/test/integrate toolchain. A hypervisor performs two main functions: (1) It manages the code running in each VM, and (2) it manages the VMs themselves. To elaborate: 1.  Code that communicates outside the VM by accessing a virtualized disk or network interface is intercepted by the hypervisor and executed by the hypervisor on behalf of the VM. This allows the hypervisor to tag these external requests so that the response to these requests can be routed to the correct VM. The response to an external request to an I/O device or the network is an asynchronous interrupt. This interrupt is initially handled by the hypervisor. Since multiple VMs are operating on a single physical host machine and each VM may have I/O requests outstanding, the hypervisor must have a method for forwarding the interrupt to the correct VM. This is the purpose of the tagging mentioned earlier.
