5.  A set of risk themes. When the analysis is complete, the evaluation team examines the full set of discovered risks to look for overarching themes that identify systemic weaknesses in the architecture or even in the architecture process and team. If left untreated, these risk themes will threaten the project’s business goals. 6.  Mapping of architectural decisions to quality requirements. Architectural decisions can be interpreted in terms of the drivers that they support or hinder. For each quality attribute scenario examined during an ATAM exercise, those architectural decisions that help to achieve it are determined and captured. They can serve as a statement of the rationales for those decisions. 7.  A set of identified sensitivity points and tradeoff points. Sensitivity points are architectural decisions that have a marked effect on a quality attribute response. Tradeoffs occur when two or more quality attribute responses are sensitive to the same architectural decision, but one of them improves while the other degrades—hence the tradeoff.
