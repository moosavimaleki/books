Evaluations can be done throughout the development process at different phases, with different evaluators, and with differences in how the evaluation is performed—we’ll cover some of the options in this chapter. Regardless of their precise details, evaluations build on the concepts you have already learned: Systems are constructed to satisfy business goals, business goals are exemplified by quality attribute scenarios, and quality attribute goals are achieved through the application of tactics and patterns. ### 21.2 What Are the Key Evaluation Activities? Regardless of who performs the evaluation and when it is performed, an evaluation is based on architectural drivers—primarily architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) expressed as quality attribute scenarios. [Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#ch19) describes how to determine ASRs. The number of ASRs that enter into the evaluation is a function of the contextual factors and the cost of the evaluation. We next describe the possible contextual factors for architecture evaluation. An evaluation can be carried out at any point in the design process where a candidate architecture, or at least a coherent reviewable part of one, exists.
