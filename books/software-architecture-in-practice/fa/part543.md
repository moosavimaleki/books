#### Timeouts Recall from [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) that timeout is a tactic for availability. In a distributed system, timeouts are used to detect failure. There are several consequences of using timeouts: *  Timeouts can’t distinguish between a failed computer or broken network connection and a slow reply to a message that exceeds the timeout period. This will cause you to label some slow responses as failures. *  A timeout will not tell you where the failure or slowness occurs. *  Many times, a request to a service triggers that service to make requests to other services, which make more requests. Even if each of the responses in this chain has a latency that is close to (but slower than) the expected average response time, the overall latency may (falsely) suggest a failure. A timeout—a decision that a response has taken too long—is commonly used to detect a failure. A timeout cannot isolate whether the failure is due to a failure in the software of the requested service, the virtual or physical machine that the service is running on, or the network connection to the service. In most cases, the cause is not important: You made a request, or you were expecting a periodic keep-alive or heartbeat message, and did not receive a timely response, and now you need to take action to remedy this.
