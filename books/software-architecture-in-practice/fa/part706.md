In perhaps the most bizarre evaluation in our experience, we lost the architect midway through phase 2. The client for this exercise was the project manager in an organization undergoing a massive restructuring. The manager was a pleasant gentleman with a quick sense of humor, but there was an undercurrent that said he was not to be crossed. The architect was being reassigned to a different part of the organization in the near future; this was tantamount to being fired from the project, and the manager said he wanted to establish the quality of the architecture before his architect’s awkward departure. (We didn’t find any of this out until after the evaluation.) When we set up the ATAM exercise, the manager suggested that the junior designers attend. “They might learn something,” he said. We agreed. As the exercise began, our schedule (which was very tight to begin with) kept being disrupted. The manager wanted us to meet with his company’s executives. Then he wanted us to have a long lunch with someone who he said could give us more architectural insights. It turned out that the executives were busy at the time of our scheduled meeting. So the manager asked if we could come back and meet with them later on.
