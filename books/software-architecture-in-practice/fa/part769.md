Which elements the developer has been assigned for implementation—that is, where functionality should be implemented. The details of the assigned element, including the data model with which it must operate. The elements with which the assigned part interfaces and what those interfaces are. The code assets that the developer can utilize. The constraints, such as quality attributes, legacy system interfaces, and budget (resource or fiscal), that must be met. A developer, then, is likely to want to see Module views. Decomposition, uses and/or layered, and generalization. Component-and-connector (C&C) views. Various, showing the component(s) the developer was assigned and the components they interact with. Allocation views. Deployment, implementation, and installation. Other. System overview; a context diagram containing the module(s) the developer has been assigned; the interface documentation of the developer’s element(s) and the interface documentation of those elements with which they interact; a variability guide to implement required variability; and rationale and constraints.
