Even better than keeping up with change is staying one step ahead of it. If you get wind of a change to the ASRs, you can take preliminary steps to design for it, as an exercise to understand the implications. If the change will be prohibitively expensive, sharing that information with the stakeholders will be a valuable contribution, and the earlier they know it, the better. Even more valuable might be suggestions about changes that would do (almost) as well in meeting the goals but without breaking the budget. ### 19.6 Summary Architectures are driven by architecturally significant requirements. An ASR must have: *  A profound impact on the architecture. Including this requirement will likely result in a different architecture than if it were not included. *  A high business or mission value. If the architecture is going to satisfy this requirement—potentially at the expense of not satisfying others—it must be of high value to important stakeholders.
