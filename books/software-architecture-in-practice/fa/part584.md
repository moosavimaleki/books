*  Reading raw data. The lowest level of the stack is a software driver to read the raw data. The driver reads the sensor either directly or, in the case where the sensor is a portion of a sensor hub, through the hub. The driver gets a reading from the sensor periodically. The period frequency is a parameter that will influence both the processor load from reading and processing the sensor and the accuracy of the created representation. *  Smoothing data. Raw data usually has a great deal of noise or variation. Voltage variations, dirt or grime on a sensor, and a myriad of other causes can make two successive readings of a sensor differ. Smoothing is a process that uses a series of measurements over time to produce an estimate that tends to be more accurate than single readings. Calculating a moving average and using a Kalman filter are two of the many techniques for smoothing data.
