For an architect, successful time coordination involves knowing whether you really need to rely on actual clock times, or whether ensuring correct sequencing suffices. If the former is important, then know your accuracy requirements and choose a solution accordingly. #### Data Coordination in a Distributed System Consider the problem of creating a resource lock to be shared across distributed machines. Suppose some critical resource is being accessed by service instances on two distinct VMs running on two distinct physical computers. We assume this critical resource is a data itemâ€”for example, your bank account balance. Changing the account balance requires reading the current balance, adding or subtracting the transaction amount, and then writing back the new balance. If we allow both service instances to operate independently on this data item, there is the possibility of a race condition, such as two simultaneous deposits overwriting each other. The standard solution in this situation is to lock the data item, so that a service cannot access your account balance until it gets the lock. We avoid a race condition because service instance 1 is granted a lock on your bank account and can work in isolation to make its deposit until it yields the lock. Then service instance 2, which has been waiting for the lock to become available, can lock the bank account and make the second deposit.
