Within all of these categories, the technologies and the standards are evolving rapidly. #### The Architectâ€™s Concerns Designing for communication and network connectivity requires the architect to balance a large number of concerns, including the following: *  Number of communication interfaces to support. With all of the different protocols and their rapid evolution, it is tempting for an architect to include all possible kinds of network interfaces. The goal when designing a mobile system is just the opposite: Only the strictly required interfaces should be included to optimize power consumption, heat generation, and space allocation. *  Movement from one protocol to another. Despite the need to take a minimalist approach to interfaces, the architect must account for the possibility that during the course of a session, the mobile system may move from an environment that supports one protocol to an environment that supports another protocol. For example, a video may be streaming on Wi-Fi, but then the system may move to an environment without Wi-Fi and the video will be received over a cellular network. Such transitions should be seamless to the user.
