*  Functionality. What functions does an element perform? This property can be used to reason about the end-to-end computation performed by a system. *  Security. Does a component or a connector enforce or provide security features, such as encryption, audit trails, or authentication? This property can be used to determine potential system security vulnerabilities. *  Concurrency. Does this component execute as a separate process or thread? This property can help to analyze or simulate the performance of concurrent components and identify possible deadlocks and bottlenecks. *  Runtime extensibility. Does the messaging structure support evolving data exchanges? Can the connectors be adapted to process those new message types? C&C views are commonly used to show developers and other stakeholders how the system works: One can “animate” or trace through a C&C view, showing an end-to-end thread of activity. C&C views are also used to reason about runtime system quality attributes, such as performance and availability. In particular, a well-documented view allows architects to predict overall system properties such as latency or reliability, given estimates or measurements of properties of the individual elements and their interactions.
