4. Research a costly system failure that could be attributed to one or more poor architectural decisions. Do you think an architecture evaluation might have caught the risks? If so, compare the cost of the failure with the cost of the evaluation. 5. It is not uncommon for an organization to evaluate two competing architectures. How would you modify the ATAM to produce a quantitative output that facilitates this comparison? 6. Suppose you’ve been asked to evaluate the architecture for a system in confidence. The architect isn’t available. You aren’t allowed to discuss the evaluation with any of the system’s stakeholders. How would you proceed? 7. Under what circumstances would you want to employ a full-strength ATAM, and under what circumstances would you want to employ an LAE?
