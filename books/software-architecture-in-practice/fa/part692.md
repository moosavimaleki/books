##### Step 2: Present the Business Goals Everyone involved in the evaluation—the project representatives as well as the evaluation team members—needs to understand the context for the system and the primary business goals motivating its development. In this step, a project decision maker (ideally the project manager or customer representative) presents a system overview from a business perspective. This presentation should describe the following aspects of the project: *  The system’s most important functions *  Any relevant technical, managerial, economic, or political constraints *  The business goals and context as they relate to the project *  The major stakeholders *  The architectural drivers (emphasizing architecturally significant requirements) ##### Step 3: Present the Architecture The lead architect (or architecture team) makes a presentation describing the architecture at an appropriate level of detail. The “appropriate level” depends on several factors: how much of the architecture has been designed and documented, how much time is available, and the nature of the behavioral and quality requirements.
