The key question is this: How much up-front work, in terms of requirements analysis, risk mitigation, and architecture design, should a project undertake? There is no single right answer to this question, but you can find a “sweet spot” for any given project. The “right” amount of project work depends on several factors, with the most dominant being project size, but other important factors include complex functional requirements, highly demanding quality attribute requirements, volatile requirements (related to the “precedentedness” or novelty of the domain), and degree of distribution of development. So how do architects achieve the right amount of agility? [Figure 24.1](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig01) shows your options. You can opt for waterfall-style “Big Design Up Front” (BDUF), shown in [Figure 24.1(a)](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig01). Or you can throw architectural caution to the wind and trust in what Agilistas call the “emergent” approach, wherein the final architecture emerges as coders deliver their increments, shown in [Figure 24.1(b)](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig01). That approach may work for small, simple projects that can turn on a dime and simply refactor on demand, but we have never seen it work for large, complex projects.
