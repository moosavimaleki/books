Each transition in a state machine diagram is labeled with the event causing the transition. For example, in [Figure 22.4](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig04), the transitions correspond to the buttons the driver can press or driving actions that affect the cruise control system. Optionally, the transition can specify a guard condition, which is enclosed in brackets. When the event corresponding to the transition occurs, the guard condition is evaluated and the transition is enabled only if the guard is true at that time. Transitions can also have consequences, called actions or effects, which are indicated by a slash. When an action is present, it indicates that the behavior following the slash will be performed when the transition occurs. The states may also specify entry and exit actions. ### 22.6 Beyond Views In addition to views and behavior, comprehensive information about an architecture will include the following items: *  Mapping between views. Because all the views of an architecture describe the same system, it stands to reason that any two views will have much in common. Combining views (as described in [Section 22.4](ch22.xhtml#ch22lev1sec4)) produces a set of views. Illuminating the associations among those views can then help that reader gain a powerful insight into how the architecture works as a unified conceptual whole.
