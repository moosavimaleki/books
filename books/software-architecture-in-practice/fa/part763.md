*  Glossary and acronym list. Likely your architecture will contain many specialized terms and acronyms. Decoding these for your readers will ensure that all your stakeholders are speaking the same language, as it were. *  Document control information. List the issuing organization, the current version number, the date of issue and status, a change history, and the procedure for submitting change requests to the document. Usually this information is captured in the front matter. Change control tools can provide much of this information. ### 22.7 Documenting the Rationale When designing, you make important design decisions to achieve the goals of each iteration. These design decisions include: *  Selecting a design concept from several alternatives *  Creating structures by instantiating the selected design concept *  Establishing relationships between elements and defining interfaces *  Allocating resources (e.g., people, hardware, computation) When you study a diagram that represents an architecture, you see the end product of a thought process but canâ€™t always easily understand the decisions that were made to achieve this result. Recording design decisions beyond the representation of the chosen elements, relationships, and properties is fundamental to help in understanding how you arrived at the result; in other words, it lays out the design rationale.
