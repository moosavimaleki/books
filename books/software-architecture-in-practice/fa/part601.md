### 18.6 Summary Mobile systems span a broad range of forms and applications, from smartphones and tablets to vehicles such as automobiles and aircraft. We have categorized the differences between mobile systems and fixed systems as being based on five characteristics: energy, connectivity, sensors, resources, and life cycle. The energy in many mobile systems comes from batteries. Batteries are monitored to determine both the remaining time on the battery and the usage of individual applications. Energy usage can be controlled by throttling individual applications. Applications should be constructed to survive power failures and restart seamlessly when power is restored. Connectivity means connecting to other systems and the Internet through wireless means. Wireless communication can be via short-distance protocols such as Bluetooth, medium-range protocols such as Wi-Fi protocols, and long-distance cellular protocols. Communication should be seamless when moving from one protocol class to another, and considerations such as bandwidth and cost help the architect decide which protocols to support.
