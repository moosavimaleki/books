*  Other environmental concerns. Other concerns include exposure to adverse conditions such as moisture or dust, or being dropped. #### The Architectâ€™s Concerns An architect must make a number of important decisions surrounding resources and their usage: *  Assigning tasks to electronic control units (ECUs). Larger mobile systems, such as cars or airplanes, have multiple ECUs of differing power and capacity. A software architect must decide which subsystems will be assigned to which ECUs. This decision can be based on a number of factors: Fit of the ECU to the function. Functions must be allocated to ECUs with sufficient power to perform the function. Some ECUs may have specialized processors; for example, an ECU with a graphics processor is a better fit for graphics functions. Criticality. More powerful ECUs may be reserved for critical functions. For example, engine controllers are more critical and more reliable than the comfort features subsystem.
