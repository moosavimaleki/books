### 20.7 Summary Design is hard. Methods are needed to make it more tractable (and repeatable). In this chapter, we discussed the attribute-driven design (ADD) method in detail; it allows an architecture to be designed in a systematic and cost-effective way. We also discussed several important aspects that need to be considered in the steps of the design process. These aspects include the identification and selection of design concepts, their use in producing structures, the definition of interfaces, the production of preliminary documentation, and ways to track design progress. ### 20.8 For Further Reading The first version of ADD, initially called “Architecture-Based Design,” was documented in [[Bachmann 00b](ref01.xhtml#ref_8)]. A description of ADD 2.0 was subsequently published in 2006. It was the first method to focus specifically on QAs and their achievement through the selection of different types of structures and their representation through views. Version 2.0 of ADD was first documented in an SEI Technical Report [[Wojcik 06](ref01.xhtml#ref_253)].
