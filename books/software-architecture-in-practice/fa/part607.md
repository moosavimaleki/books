## 19 Architecturally Significant Requirements The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what you are trying to build. —Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++ Architectures exist to build systems that satisfy requirements. By “requirements,” we do not necessarily mean a documented catalog produced using the best techniques that requirements engineering has to offer. Instead, we mean the set of properties that, if not satisfied by your system, will cause the system to be a failure. Requirements exist in as many forms as there are software development projects—from polished specifications to verbal shared understanding (real or imagined) among principal stakeholders. The technical, economic, and philosophical justifications for your project’s requirements practices are beyond the scope of this book. What is in scope is that, regardless of how they are captured, they establish the criteria for success or failure, and architects need to know them. To an architect, not all requirements are created equal. Some have a much more profound effect on the architecture than others. An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that will have a profound effect on the architecture—that is, the architecture might well be dramatically different in the absence of such a requirement.
