![An example UML sequence diagram.](graphics/22fig02.jpg) Figure 22.2 A simple example of a UML sequence diagram A UML sequence diagram is illustrated with the key. A human symbol represents the actor. A square represents the object. A vertical line with a break in the center represents a lifeline. A vertical rectangle with vertical lines at the top and bottom represents an execution occurrence. A bold right arrow represents the synchronous message. A right arrow represents an asynchronous message. A dashed right arrow represents a return message. The user actor is shown on the left. Four objects login page, login controller, user direct access object, and logger are displayed horizontally on the right of the user. The user sends a login synchronous message to the object login page. The login function from the login page is sent to the login controller as a synchronous message. Then, the check pwd function from the login controller is sent to the user direct access object. After the execution occurrence, this object sends back the return message to the login controller. A new synchronous message is sent from the login controller to the user session object created before the logger object. After the execution occurrence, the user session sends a return message to the login controller. Now the login controller sends an asynchronous message to register user login to the logger. The execution of the login controller is now complete and sends a return message to the login page. The execution of the login page is now complete and a return message is sent to the user.
