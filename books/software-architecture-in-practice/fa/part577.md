*  Example software requirements: The runtime environment can be killed at any moment without affecting the integrity of the binaries, configurations, and operational data in permanent storage, and while keeping the state consistent after a restart (whether that is a reset or a resume). Applications need a strategy to deal with data that arrives while the application is inoperative. The runtime can start after a failure so that the startup time, from system power on to the software being in a ready state, is less than a specified period. *  The runtime environment can be killed at any moment without affecting the integrity of the binaries, configurations, and operational data in permanent storage, and while keeping the state consistent after a restart (whether that is a reset or a resume). *  Applications need a strategy to deal with data that arrives while the application is inoperative. *  The runtime can start after a failure so that the startup time, from system power on to the software being in a ready state, is less than a specified period.
