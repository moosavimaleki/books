*  Converting data. Sensors can report data in many formatsâ€”from voltage readings in millivolts to altitude above sea level in feet to temperature in degrees Celsius. It is possible, however, that two different sensors measuring the same phenomenon might report their data in different formats. The converter is responsible for converting readings from whatever form is reported by the sensor into a common form meaningful to the application. As you might imagine, this function may need to deal with a wide variety of sensors. *  Sensor fusion. Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to build a more accurate or more complete or more dependable representation of the environment than would be possible from any individual sensor. For example, how does an automobile recognize pedestrians in its path or likely to be in its path by the time it gets there, day or night, in all kinds of weather? No single sensor can accomplish this feat. Instead, the automobile must intelligently combine inputs from sensors such as thermal imagers, radar, lidar, and cameras.
