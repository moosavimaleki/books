You should develop a discipline of writing down the responsibilities that you allocate to the elements as you create the structures. The reasons for this are simple: As you identify an element, you are determining some responsibilities for that element in your mind. Writing them down at that moment ensures that you wonâ€™t have to remember the intended responsibilities later. Also, it is easier to write down the responsibilities associated with your elements gradually, rather than documenting all of them together at a later time. Creating this preliminary documentation as you design the architecture requires some discipline. The benefits are worth the effort, though, as you will be able to later produce the more detailed architecture documentation relatively easily and quickly. One simple way to document responsibilities, if you are using a whiteboard or a flipchart, is to take a photo of the sketch that you have produced and paste it in a document, along with a table that summarizes the responsibilities of every element depicted in the diagram (see an example in [Figure 20.4](ch20.xhtml#ch20fig04)). If you use a design tool, you can select an element to create and use the text area that usually appears in the properties sheet of the element to document its responsibilities, and then generate the documentation automatically.
