*  Leverage your own knowledge and experience. If the system you are designing is similar to other systems you have designed in the past, you will probably want to begin with some of the design concepts that you have used before. The benefit of this approach is that the identification of alternatives can be performed rapidly and confidently. The downside is that you may end up using the same ideas repeatedly, even if they are not the most appropriate for all the design problems that you are facing, or if they have been superseded by newer, better approaches. As the saying goes: If all you have is a hammer, all the world looks like a nail. *  Leverage the knowledge and experience of others. As an architect, you have a background and knowledge that you have gained through the years. This background and knowledge will vary from person to person, especially if the types of design problems they have addressed in the past differ. You can leverage this information by performing the identification and selection of design concepts with some of your peers through brainstorming.
