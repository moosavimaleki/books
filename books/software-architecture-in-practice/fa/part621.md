Architects often become aware of an organization’s business and business goals via osmosis—working, listening, talking, and soaking up the goals that are at work in an organization. Osmosis is not without its benefits, but more systematic ways of determining such goals are both possible and desirable. Moreover, it is worthwhile to capture business goals explicitly, because they often imply ASRs that would otherwise go undetected until it is too late or too expensive to address them. One way to do this is to employ the PALM method, which entails holding a workshop with the architect and key business stakeholders. The heart of PALM consists of these steps: *  Business goals elicitation. Using the categories given later in this section to guide the discussion, capture from stakeholders the set of important business goals for this system. Elaborate the business goals and express them as business goal scenarios.[1](ch19.xhtml#ch19fn1a) Consolidate almost-alike business goals to eliminate duplication. Have the participants prioritize the resulting set to identify the most important goals.
