Recall from [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01) that one of the allocation structures is the work assignment structure, which allocates modules to teams for development. That allocation can also be changed, depending on the “load”—in this case, the load on development teams already at work. #### Quality Views Module, C&C, and allocation views are all structural views: They primarily show the structures that the architect has designed into the architecture to satisfy functional and quality attribute requirements. These views are excellent choices for guiding and constraining downstream developers, whose primary job is to implement those structures. However, in systems in which certain quality attributes (or, for that matter, any stakeholder concerns) are particularly important and pervasive, structural views may not be the best way to present the architectural solution to those needs. The reason is that the solution may be spread across multiple structures that are cumbersome to combine (e.g., because the element types shown in each structure are different).
