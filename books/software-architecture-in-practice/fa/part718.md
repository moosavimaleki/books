—RK ### 21.7 Summary If a system is important enough for you to explicitly design its architecture, then that architecture should be evaluated. The number of evaluations and the extent of each evaluation may vary from project to project. A designer should perform an evaluation during the process of making an important decision. The ATAM is a comprehensive method for evaluating software architectures. It works by having project decision makers and stakeholders articulate a precise list of quality attribute requirements (in the form of scenarios) and by illuminating the architectural decisions relevant to analyzing each high-priority scenario. The decisions can then be understood in terms of risks or non-risks to find any trouble spots in the architecture. Lightweight evaluations can be performed regularly as part of a project’s internal peer review activities. Lightweight Architecture Evaluation, based on the ATAM, provides an inexpensive, low-ceremony architecture evaluation that can be carried out in less than a day.
