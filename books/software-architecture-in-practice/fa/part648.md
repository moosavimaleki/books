To address a specific design problem, you can and often will use and combine different types of design concepts. For example, to address a security driver, you might employ a security pattern, a security tactic, a security framework, or some combination of these. Once you have more clarity regarding the types of design concepts that you wish to use, you still need to identify alternativesâ€”that is, design candidates. You can achieve this in several ways, although you will probably use a combination of these techniques rather than a single method: *  Leverage existing best practices. You can identify alternatives by making use of existing catalogs. Some design concepts, such as patterns, are extensively documented; others, such as externally developed components, are documented in a less thorough way. The benefits of this approach are that you can identify many alternatives and leverage the considerable knowledge and experience of others. The downsides are that searching and studying the information can require a considerable amount of time, the quality of the documented knowledge is often unknown, and the assumptions and biases of the authors are also unknown.
