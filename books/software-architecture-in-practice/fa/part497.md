*  The element is not configured correctly. For example, its database connection string refers to the wrong database server. Indicating the source of the error helps the system choose the appropriate correction and recovery strategy. Temporary errors with idempotent operations can be dealt with by waiting and retrying. Errors due to invalid input require fixing the bad requests and resending them. Missing dependencies should be reinstalled before reattempting to use the interface. Implementation bugs should be fixed by adding the usage failure scenario as an additional test case to avoid regressions. ### 15.3 Documenting the Interface Although an interface comprises all aspects of the interaction that an element has with its environment, what we choose to disclose about an interface—that is, what we put in an interface’s documentation—is more limited. Writing down every aspect of every possible interaction is not practical and almost never desirable. Rather, you should expose only what the actors on an interface need to know to interact with it. Put another way, you choose what information is permissible and appropriate for people to assume about the element.
