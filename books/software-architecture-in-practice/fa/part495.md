Actors need to know whether the element is working correctly, whether their interaction is successful and whether an error has occurred. Strategies to do so include the following: *  Failed operations may throw an exception. *  Operations may return a status indicator with predefined codes, which would need to be tested to detect erroneous outcomes. *  Properties may be used to store data indicating whether the latest operation was successful or not, or whether stateful elements are in an erroneous state. *  Error events such as a timeout may be triggered for failed asynchronous interactions. *  The error log may be read by connecting to a specific output data stream. The specification of which exceptions, which status codes, which events, and which information are used to describe erroneous outcomes becomes part of the interface of an element. Common sources of errors (which the interface should handle gracefully) include the following:
