[Table 22.2](ch22.xhtml#ch22tab02) summarizes the characteristics of C&C views. Table 22.2 Summary of C&C Views Elements *  Components: principal processing units and data stores. *  Connectors: pathways of interaction between components. Relations *  Attachments: Components are associated with connectors to yield a graph. Constraints Components can only be attached to connectors, and connectors can only be attached to components. *  Attachments can only be made between compatible components and connectors. *  Connectors cannot appear in isolation; a connector must be attached to a component. Usage Show how the system works. *  Guide development by specifying the structure and behavior of runtime elements. *  Help reason about runtime system quality attributes, such as performance and availability. ##### Notations for C&C Views As always, box-and-line drawings are available to represent C&C views. Although informal notations are limited in terms of the semantics that they can convey, following some simple guidelines can lend rigor and depth to the descriptions. The primary guideline is simple: Assign each component type and each connector type a separate symbol, and list each of the types in a key.
