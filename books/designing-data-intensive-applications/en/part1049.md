When maintaining derived data, the order of state changes is often important (if several views are
derived from an event log, they need to process the events in the same order so that they remain
consistent with each other).  As discussed in [“Acknowledgments and redelivery”](ch11.html#sec_stream_reordering), many message brokers do
not have this property when redelivering unacknowledged messages. Dual writes are also ruled out
(see [“Keeping Systems in Sync”](ch11.html#sec_stream_sync)). *  Fault tolerance is key for derived data: losing just a single message causes the derived dataset
to go permanently out of sync with its data source. Both message delivery and derived state
updates must be reliable. For example, many actor systems by default maintain actor state and
messages in memory, so they are lost if the machine running the actor crashes. 
Stable message ordering and fault-tolerant message processing are quite stringent demands, but they
are much less expensive and more operationally robust than distributed transactions. Modern stream
processors can provide these ordering and reliability guarantees at scale, and they allow
application code to be run as stream operators.
