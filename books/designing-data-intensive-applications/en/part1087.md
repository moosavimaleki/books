This is not the case when unbundling an operation across multiple stages of stream processors:
consumers of a log are asynchronous by design, so a sender does not wait until its message has been
processed by consumers. However, it is possible for a client to wait for a message to appear on an
output stream. This is what we did in [“Uniqueness in log-based messaging”](#sec_future_uniqueness_log) when checking whether a
uniqueness constraint was satisfied. In this example, the correctness of the uniqueness check does not depend on whether the sender of
the message waits for the outcome. The waiting only has the purpose of synchronously informing the
sender whether or not the uniqueness check succeeded, but this notification can be decoupled from
the effects of processing the message. 
More generally, I think the term consistency conflates two different requirements that are worth
considering separately: Timeliness 
Timeliness means ensuring that users observe the system in an up-to-date state. We saw previously
that if a user reads from a stale copy of the data, they may observe it in an inconsistent state
(see [“Problems with Replication Lag”](ch05.html#sec_replication_lag)). However, that inconsistency is temporary, and will eventually be
resolved simply by waiting and trying again.
