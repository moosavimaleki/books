For example, I would love it if we could simply declare mysql | elasticsearch, by analogy to Unix
pipes [[22](ch12.html#Kleppmann2015tz_ch12)], which would be the
unbundled equivalent of CREATE INDEX: it would take all the documents in a MySQL database and
index them in an Elasticsearch cluster. It would then continually capture all the changes made to
the database and automatically apply them to the search index, without us having to write custom
application code. This kind of integration should be possible with almost any kind of storage or
indexing system. 
Similarly, it would be great to be able to precompute and update caches more easily. Recall that a
materialized view is essentially a precomputed cache, so you could imagine creating a cache by
declaratively specifying materialized views for complex queries, including recursive queries on
graphs (see [“Graph-Like Data Models”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_graph)) and application logic. There is interesting early-stage
research in this area, such as differential dataflow
[[24](ch12.html#McSherry2013tt),
[25](ch12.html#Murray2013jg)],
and I hope that these ideas will find their way into production systems.
