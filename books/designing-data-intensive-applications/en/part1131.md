It took a long time before safeguards were established, such as environmental protection
regulations, safety protocols for workplaces, outlawing child labor, and health inspections for
food. Undoubtedly the cost of doing business increased when factories could no longer dump their
waste into rivers, sell tainted foods, or exploit workers. But society as a whole benefited hugely,
and few of us would want to return to a time before those regulations

information age has major problems that we need to confront and solve. I believe that the collection
and use of data is one of those problems. In the words of Bruce Schneier
[[96](ch12.html#Schneier2015vf)]: Data is the pollution problem of the information age, and protecting privacy is the environmental
challenge. Almost all computers produce information. It stays around, festering. How we deal with
it—how we contain it and how we dispose of it—is central to the health of our information
economy. Just as we look back today at the early decades of the industrial age and wonder how our
ancestors could have ignored pollution in their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren
will look back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge us on how we
addressed the challenge of data collection and misuse.
