From this example we can see that an index is not the only possible boundary between the write path
and the read path. Caching of common search results is possible, and grep-like scanning without
the index is also possible on a small number of documents. Viewed like this, the role of caches,
indexes, and materialized views is simple: they shift the boundary between the read path and the
write path.  They allow us to do more work on the write path, by precomputing results, in order to
save effort on the read path. 
Shifting the boundary between work done on the write path and the read path was in fact the topic of
the Twitter example at the beginning of this book, in [“Describing Load”](ch01.html#sec_introduction_scalability_load). In that
example, we also saw how the boundary between write path and read path might be drawn differently
for celebrities compared to ordinary users. After 500 pages we have come full circle!
