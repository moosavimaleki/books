Although immutability is useful, it is not a cure-all by itself. Let’s look at a more subtle example
of data corruption that can occur. ### Exactly-once execution of an operation 
In [“Fault Tolerance”](ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance) we encountered an idea called exactly-once (or
effectively-once) semantics. If something goes wrong while processing a message, you can either
give up (drop the message—i.e., incur data loss) or try again. If you try again, there is the risk
that it actually succeeded the first time, but you just didn’t find out about the success, and so
the message ends up being processed twice. Processing twice is a form of data corruption: it is undesirable to charge a customer twice for the
same service (billing them too much) or increment a counter twice (overstating some metric). In this
context, exactly-once means arranging the computation such that the final effect is the same as if
no faults had occurred, even if the operation actually was retried due to some fault. We previously
discussed a few approaches for achieving this goal.
