## The Birth of NoSQL 
Now, in the 2010s, NoSQL is the latest attempt to overthrow the relational model’s dominance. The
name “NoSQL” is unfortunate, since it doesn’t actually refer to any particular technology—it was
originally intended simply as a catchy Twitter hashtag for a meetup on open source, distributed, nonrelational
databases in 2009 [[3](ch02.html#nosql-distilled)]. Nevertheless, the term struck a nerve and quickly spread through the
web startup community and beyond. A number of interesting database systems are now associated with
the #NoSQL hashtag, and it has been retroactively reinterpreted as Not Only SQL
[[4](ch02.html#Evans2009tc)]. There are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases, including: *  A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, including very large
datasets or very high write throughput *  A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial database products *  Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model
