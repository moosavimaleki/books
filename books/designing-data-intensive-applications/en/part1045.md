### Separation of application code and state 
In theory, databases could be deployment environments for arbitrary application code, like an
operating system. However, in practice they have turned out to be poorly suited for this purpose.
They do not fit well with the requirements of modern application development, such as dependency and
package management, version control, rolling upgrades, evolvability, monitoring, metrics, calls to
network services, and integration with external systems. 
On the other hand, deployment and cluster management tools such as Mesos, YARN, Docker, Kubernetes,
and others are designed specifically for the purpose of running application code. By focusing on
doing one thing well, they are able to do it much better than a database that provides execution of
user-defined functions as one of its many features. I think it makes sense to have some parts of a system that specialize in durable data storage, and
other parts that specialize in running application code. The two can interact while still remaining
independent.
