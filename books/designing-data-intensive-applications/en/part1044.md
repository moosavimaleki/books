The derivation function for a secondary index is so commonly required that it is built into many
databases as a core feature, and you can invoke it by merely saying CREATE INDEX. For full-text
indexing, basic linguistic features for common languages may be built into a database, but the more
sophisticated features often require domain-specific tuning. In machine learning, feature
engineering is notoriously application-specific, and often has to incorporate detailed knowledge
about the user interaction and deployment of an application
[[35](ch12.html#Sculley2014un)]. 
When the function that creates a derived dataset is not a standard cookie-cutter function like
creating a secondary index, custom code is required to handle the application-specific aspects. And
this custom code is where many databases struggle. Although relational databases commonly support
triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions, which can be used to execute application
code within the database, they have been somewhat of an afterthought in database design (see
[“Transmitting Event Streams”](ch11.html#sec_stream_transmit)).
