
The CAP theorem (see [“The Cost of Linearizability”](ch09.html#sec_linearizability_cost)) uses consistency in the sense of linearizability,
which is a strong way of achieving timeliness. Weaker timeliness properties like read-after-write
consistency (see [“Reading Your Own Writes”](ch05.html#sec_replication_ryw)) can also be useful. Integrity 
Integrity means absence of corruption; i.e., no data loss, and no contradictory or false data. In
particular, if some derived dataset is maintained as a view onto some underlying data (see
[“Deriving current state from the event log”](ch11.html#sec_stream_state_from_log)), the derivation must be correct. For example, a database index must
correctly reflect the contents of the database—an index in which some records are missing is
not very useful. If integrity is violated, the inconsistency is permanent: waiting and trying again is not going to
fix database corruption in most cases. Instead, explicit checking and repair is needed. In the
context of ACID transactions (see [“The Meaning of ACID”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid)), consistency is usually understood as
some kind of application-specific notion of integrity. Atomicity and durability are important tools
for preserving integrity.
