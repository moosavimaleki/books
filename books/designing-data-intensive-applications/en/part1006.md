
The goal of this book was outlined in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch_introduction): to explore how to create applications and
systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. These themes have run through all of
the chapters: for example, we discussed many fault-tolerance algorithms that help improve
reliability, partitioning to improve scalability, and mechanisms for evolution and abstraction that
improve maintainability. In this chapter we will bring all of these ideas together, and build on
them to envisage the future. Our goal is to discover how to design applications that are better than
the ones of today—robust, correct, evolvable, and ultimately beneficial to humanity. # Data Integration 
A recurring theme in this book has been that for any given problem, there are several solutions, all
of which have different pros, cons, and trade-offs. For example, when discussing storage engines in
[Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch_storage), we saw log-structured storage, B-trees, and column-oriented storage. When discussing
replication in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch_replication), we saw single-leader, multi-leader, and leaderless approaches.
