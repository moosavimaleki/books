linearizable 
Behaving as if there was only a single copy of data in the system, which is updated by atomic
operations. See [“Linearizability”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_linearizability). locality 
A performance optimization: putting several pieces of data in the same place if they are
frequently needed at the same time. See [“Data locality for queries”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_document_locality). lock 
A mechanism to ensure that only one thread, node, or transaction can access something, and anyone
else who wants to access the same thing must wait until the lock is released. See
[“Two-Phase Locking (2PL)”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_2pl) and [“The leader and the lock”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_lock_fencing). log 
An append-only file for storing data. A write-ahead log is used to make a storage engine
resilient against crashes (see [“Making B-trees reliable”](ch03.html#sec_storage_btree_wal)), a log-structured storage engine
uses logs as its primary storage format (see [“SSTables and LSM-Trees”](ch03.html#sec_storage_lsm_trees)), a replication log is
used to copy writes from a leader to followers (see [“Leaders and Followers”](ch05.html#sec_replication_leader)), and an event
log can represent a data stream (see [“Partitioned Logs”](ch11.html#sec_stream_log)).
