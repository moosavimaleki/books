Unbundled databases: unifying writes While federation addresses read-only querying across several different systems, it does not have a
good answer to synchronizing writes across those systems. We said that within a single database,
creating a consistent index is a built-in feature. When we compose several storage systems, we
similarly need to ensure that all data changes end up in all the right places, even in the face of
faults. Making it easier to reliably plug together storage systems (e.g., through change data
capture and event logs) is like unbundling a databaseâ€™s index-maintenance features in a way that
can synchronize writes across disparate technologies
[[7](ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12),
[21](ch12.html#Lomet2009tc)]. 
The unbundled approach follows the Unix tradition of small tools that do one thing well
[[22](ch12.html#Kleppmann2015tz_ch12)], that communicate through a uniform low-level API (pipes), and that can be
composed using a higher-level language (the shell)
[[16](ch12.html#Ritchie1974gg)]. ### Making unbundling work Federation and unbundling are two sides of the same coin: composing a reliable, scalable, and
maintainable system out of diverse components. Federated read-only querying requires mapping one
data model into another, which takes some thought but is ultimately quite a manageable problem. I
think that keeping the writes to several storage systems in sync is the harder engineering problem,
and so I will focus on it.
