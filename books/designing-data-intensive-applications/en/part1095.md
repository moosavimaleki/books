These applications do require integrity: you would not want to lose a reservation, or have money
disappear due to mismatched credits and debits. But they don’t require timeliness on the
enforcement of the constraint: if you have sold more items than you have in the warehouse, you can
patch up the problem after the fact by apologizing. Doing so is similar to the conflict resolution
approaches we discussed in [“Handling Write Conflicts”](ch05.html#sec_replication_write_conflicts). ### Coordination-avoiding data systems 
We have now made two interesting observations: 1.  Dataflow systems can maintain integrity guarantees on derived data without atomic commit,
linearizability, or synchronous cross-partition coordination. 2.  Although strict uniqueness constraints require timeliness and coordination, many applications are
actually fine with loose constraints that may be temporarily violated and fixed up later, as long
as integrity is preserved throughout. 
Taken together, these observations mean that dataflow systems can provide the data management
services for many applications without requiring coordination, while still giving strong integrity
guarantees. Such coordination-avoiding data systems have a lot of appeal: they can achieve better
performance and fault tolerance than systems that need to perform synchronous coordination
