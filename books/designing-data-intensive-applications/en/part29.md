
There are many factors that may influence the design of a data system, including the skills and
experience of the people involved, legacy system dependencies, the timescale for delivery, your
organization’s tolerance of different kinds of risk, regulatory constraints, etc. Those factors
depend very much on the situation. In this book, we focus on three concerns that are important in most software systems: Reliability 
The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired
level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human
error). See [“Reliability”](#sec_introduction_reliability). Scalability As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable
ways of dealing with that growth. See [“Scalability”](#sec_introduction_scalability). Maintainability Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both
maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be
able to work on it productively. See [“Maintainability”](#sec_introduction_maintainability).
