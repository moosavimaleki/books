
The big advantage of log-based integration is loose coupling between the various components, which
manifests itself in two ways: 1.  
At a system level, asynchronous event streams make the system as a whole more robust to outages
or performance degradation of individual components. If a consumer runs slow or fails, the event
log can buffer messages (see [“Disk space usage”](ch11.html#sec_stream_disk_usage)), allowing the producer and any other
consumers to continue running unaffected. The faulty consumer can catch up when it is fixed, so
it doesn’t miss any data, and the fault is contained. By contrast, the synchronous interaction of
distributed transactions tends to escalate local faults into large-scale failures (see
[“Limitations of distributed transactions”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_trans_limits)). 2.  
At a human level, unbundling data systems allows different software components and services to be
developed, improved, and maintained independently from each other by different teams.
Specialization allows each team to focus on doing one thing well, with well-defined interfaces to
other teams’ systems. Event logs provide an interface that is powerful enough to capture fairly
strong consistency properties (due to durability and ordering of events), but also general enough
to be applicable to almost any kind of data.
