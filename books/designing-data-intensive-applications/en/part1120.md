This thought experiment is unusually polemic for this book, Designing Surveillance-Intensive
Applications, but I think that strong words are needed to emphasize this point. In our attempts to
make software “eat the world”
[[94](ch12.html#Andreessen2011xa)], we have built
the greatest mass surveillance infrastructure the world has ever seen. Rushing toward an Internet
of Things, we are rapidly approaching a world in which every inhabited space contains at least one
internet-connected microphone, in the form of smartphones, smart TVs, voice-controlled assistant
devices, baby monitors, and even children’s toys that use cloud-based speech recognition. Many of
these devices have a terrible security record [[95](ch12.html#Porup2016cx)]. Even the most totalitarian and repressive regimes could only dream of putting a microphone in every
room and forcing every person to constantly carry a device capable of tracking their location and
movements.  Yet we apparently voluntarily, even enthusiastically, throw ourselves into this world of
total surveillance. The difference is just that the data is being collected by corporations rather
than government agencies [[96](ch12.html#Schneier2015vf)].
