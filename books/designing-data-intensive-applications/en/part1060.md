In terms of our model of write path and read path, actively pushing state changes all the way to
client devices means extending the write path all the way to the end user. When a client is first
initialized, it would still need to use a read path to get its initial state, but thereafter it
could rely on a stream of state changes sent by the server. The ideas we discussed around stream
processing and messaging are not restricted to running only in a datacenter: we can take the ideas
further, and extend them all the way to end-user devices
[[43](ch12.html#Burckhardt2015hv)]. The devices will be offline some of the time, and unable to receive any notifications of state
changes from the server during that time. But we already solved that problem: in
[“Consumer offsets”](ch11.html#sec_stream_log_offsets) we discussed how a consumer of a log-based message broker can reconnect
after failing or becoming disconnected, and ensure that it doesn’t miss any messages that arrived
while it was disconnected. The same technique works for individual users, where each device is a
small subscriber to a small stream of events.
