*  In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most
recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc. *  From time to time, run a merging and compaction process in the background to combine segment files
and to discard overwritten or deleted values. This scheme works very well. It only suffers from one problem: if the database crashes, the most
recent writes (which are in the memtable but not yet written out to disk) are lost. In order to
avoid that problem, we can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended,
just like in the previous section. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesnâ€™t matter, because
its only purpose is to restore the memtable after a crash. Every time the memtable is written out to
an SSTable, the corresponding log can be discarded.
