days of railway building in 19th-century England there were various competing standards for the
gauge (the distance between the two rails). Trains built for one gauge couldn’t run on tracks of
another gauge, which restricted the possible interconnections in the train network
[[9](ch12.html#NetworkRail)]. After a single standard gauge was finally decided upon in 1846, tracks with other gauges had to be
converted—but how do you do this without shutting down the train line for months or years? The
solution is to first convert the track to dual gauge or mixed gauge by adding a third rail. This
conversion can be done gradually, and when it is done, trains of both gauges can run on the line,
using two of the three rails. Eventually, once all trains have been converted to the standard gauge, the
rail providing the nonstandard gauge can be removed.
