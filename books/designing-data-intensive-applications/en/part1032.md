It seems that there are parallels between the features that are built into databases and the
derived data systems that people are building with batch and stream processors. ### Creating an index 
Think about what happens when you run CREATE INDEX to create a new index in a relational database.
The database has to scan over a consistent snapshot of a table, pick out all of the field values
being indexed, sort them, and write out the index. Then it must process the backlog of writes that
have been made since the consistent snapshot was taken (assuming the table was not locked while
creating the index, so writes could continue). Once that is done, the database must continue to keep
the index up to date whenever a transaction writes to the table. This process is remarkably similar to setting up a new follower replica (see
[“Setting Up New Followers”](ch05.html#sec_replication_new_replica)), and also very similar to bootstrapping change data capture in a
streaming system (see [“Initial snapshot”](ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc_snapshot)).
