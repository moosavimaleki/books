Two-phase commit (see [“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc)) protocols break the 1:1 mapping between a TCP
connection and a transaction, since they must allow a transaction coordinator to reconnect to a
database after a network fault, and tell it whether to commit or abort an in-doubt transaction. Is
this sufficient to ensure that the transaction will only be executed once? Unfortunately not. Even if we can suppress duplicate transactions between the database client and server, we still need
to worry about the network between the end-user device and the application server. For example, if
the end-user client is a web browser, it probably uses an HTTP POST request to submit an instruction
to the server. Perhaps the user is on a weak cellular data connection, and they succeed in sending
the POST, but the signal becomes too weak before they are able to receive the response from the
server.
