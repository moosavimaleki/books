When both the writes and the reads are represented as events, and routed to the same stream operator
in order to be handled, we are in fact performing a stream-table join between the stream of read
queries and the database. The read event needs to be sent to the database partition holding the data
(see [“Request Routing”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_routing)), just like batch and stream processors need to copartition inputs
on the same key when joining (see [“Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping”](ch10.html#sec_batch_reduce_joins)). This correspondence between serving requests and performing joins is quite fundamental
[[47](ch12.html#Alvaro2015vs)]. A one-off read request just passes the request through the join
operator and then immediately forgets it; a subscribe request is a persistent join with past and
future events on the other side of the join. 
Recording a log of read events potentially also has benefits with regard to tracking causal
dependencies and data provenance across a system: it would allow you to reconstruct what the user
saw before they made a particular decision. For example, in an online shop, it is likely that the
predicted shipping date and the inventory status shown to a customer affect whether they choose to
buy an item [[4](ch12.html#Kerr2016va)]. To analyze this connection,
you need to record the result of the user’s query of the shipping and inventory status.
