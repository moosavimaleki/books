Most web applications today are deployed as stateless services, in which any user request can be
routed to any application server, and the server forgets everything about the request once it has
sent the response. This style of deployment is convenient, as servers can be added or removed at
will, but the state has to go somewhere: typically, a database. The trend has been to keep stateless
application logic separate from state management (databases): not putting application logic in the
database and not putting persistent state in the application
[[36](ch12.html#Bailis2015dn)]. As
people in the functional programming community like to joke, “We believe in the separation of Church
and state” [[37](ch12.html#Steele2001ts)].[i](ch12.html#idm140605755633424) In this typical web application model, the database acts as a kind of mutable shared variable that
can be accessed synchronously over the network. The application can read and update the variable,
and the database takes care of making it durable, providing some concurrency control and fault
tolerance.
