### Unifying batch and stream processing 
More recent work has enabled the benefits of the lambda architecture to be enjoyed without its
downsides, by allowing both batch computations (reprocessing historical data) and stream
computations (processing events as they arrive) to be implemented in the same system
[[15](ch12.html#CastroFernandez2015uz)]. Unifying batch and stream processing in one system requires the following features, which are
becoming increasingly widely available: *  
The ability to replay historical events through the same processing engine that handles the stream
of recent events. For example, log-based message brokers have the ability to replay messages (see
[“Replaying old messages”](ch11.html#sec_stream_replay)), and some stream processors can read input from a distributed filesystem
like HDFS. *  
Exactly-once semantics for stream processors—that is, ensuring that the output is the same as
if no faults had occurred, even if faults did in fact occur (see [“Fault Tolerance”](ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance)).
Like with batch processing, this requires discarding the partial output of any failed tasks.
