3.  In [Part III](part03.html#part_systems), we discuss systems that derive some datasets from other datasets. Derived
data often occurs in heterogeneous systems: when there is no one database that can do everything
well, applications need to integrate several different databases, caches, indexes, and so on. In
[Chapter 10](ch10.html#ch_batch) we start with a batch processing approach to derived data, and we build upon it with stream processing in [Chapter 11](ch11.html#ch_stream). Finally, in [Chapter 12](ch12.html#ch_future) we put everything
together and discuss approaches for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in
the future. # References and Further Reading Most of what we discuss in this book has already been said elsewhere in some form or another—in
conference presentations, research papers, blog posts, code, bug trackers, mailing lists, and
engineering folklore. This book summarizes the most important ideas from many different sources,
and it includes pointers to the original literature throughout the text. The references at the end
of each chapter are a great resource if you want to explore an area in more depth, and most of them
are freely available online.
