The goal of unbundling is not to compete with individual databases on performance for particular
workloads; the goal is to allow you to combine several different databases in order to achieve good
performance for a much wider range of workloads than is possible with a single piece of software. It’s
about breadth, not depth—in the same vein as the diversity of storage and processing models that
we discussed in [“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”](ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db). Thus, if there is a single technology that does everything you need, you’re most likely best off
simply using that product rather than trying to reimplement it yourself from lower-level components.
The advantages of unbundling and composition only come into the picture when there is no single
piece of software that satisfies all your requirements. ### What’s missing? 
The tools for composing data systems are getting better, but I think one major part is missing: we
don’t yet have the unbundled-database equivalent of the Unix shell (i.e., a high-level language for
composing storage and processing systems in a simple and declarative way).
