### Unbundled versus integrated systems 
If unbundling does indeed become the way of the future, it will not replace databases in their
current form—they will still be needed as much as ever. Databases are still required for
maintaining state in stream processors, and in order to serve queries for the output of batch and
stream processors (see [“The Output of Batch Workflows”](ch10.html#sec_batch_output) and [“Processing Streams”](ch11.html#sec_stream_processing)). Specialized query
engines will continue to be important for particular workloads: for example, query engines in MPP
data warehouses are optimized for exploratory analytic queries and handle this kind of workload
very well (see [“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”](ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db)). The complexity of running several different pieces of infrastructure can be a problem: each piece of
software has a learning curve, configuration issues, and operational quirks, and so it is worth
deploying as few moving parts as possible. A single integrated software product may also be able to
achieve better and more predictable performance on the kinds of workloads for which it is designed,
compared to a system consisting of several tools that you have composed with application code
[[23](ch12.html#Hugg2016tq)].
As I said in the [Preface](preface01.html#preface), building for scale that you don’t need is wasted effort and may lock you
into an inflexible design. In effect, it is a form of premature optimization.
