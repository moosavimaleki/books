CAP theorem 
A widely misunderstood theoretical result that is not useful in practice. See
[“The CAP theorem”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_cap). causality 
The dependency between events that arises when one thing “happens before” another thing in a
system. For example, a later event that is in response to an earlier event, or builds upon an
earlier event, or should be understood in the light of an earlier event. See
[“The “happens-before” relationship and concurrency”](ch05.html#sec_replication_happens_before) and [“Ordering and Causality”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_causality). consensus 
A fundamental problem in distributed computing, concerning getting several nodes to agree on
something (for example, which node should be the leader for a database cluster). The problem is
much harder than it seems at first glance. See [“Fault-Tolerant Consensus”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_consensus_ft). data warehouse 
A database in which data from several different OLTP systems has been combined and prepared to be
used for analytics purposes. See [“Data Warehousing”](ch03.html#sec_storage_dwh). declarative 
Describing the properties that something should have, but not the exact steps for how to achieve
it. In the context of queries, a query optimizer takes a declarative query and decides how it
should best be executed. See [“Query Languages for Data”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_query).
