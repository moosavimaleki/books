Not all data collection necessarily qualifies as surveillance, but examining it as such can help us
understand our relationship with the data collector. Why are we seemingly happy to accept
surveillance by corporations? Perhaps you feel you have nothing to hide—in other words, you are
totally in line with existing power structures, you are not a marginalized minority, and you needn’t
fear persecution [[97](ch12.html#Grugq2016nw)]. Not everyone is so fortunate. Or perhaps it’s
because the purpose seems benign—it’s not overt coercion and conformance, but merely better
recommendations and more personalized marketing. However, combined with the discussion of predictive
analytics from the last section, that distinction seems less clear. We are already seeing car insurance premiums linked to tracking devices in cars, and health
insurance coverage that depends on people wearing a fitness tracking device. When surveillance is
used to determine things that hold sway over important aspects of life, such as insurance coverage
or employment, it starts to appear less benign. Moreover, data analysis can reveal surprisingly
intrusive things: for example, the movement sensor in a smartwatch or fitness tracker can be used to
work out what you are typing (for example, passwords) with fairly good accuracy
[[98](ch12.html#Beltramelli2015wk)]. And algorithms for analysis are only going to get better.
