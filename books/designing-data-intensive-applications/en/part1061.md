### End-to-end event streams 
Recent tools for developing stateful clients and user interfaces, such as the Elm language
[[30](ch12.html#Czaplicki2013ig)] and Facebook’s toolchain of
React, Flux, and Redux [[44](ch12.html#Soper2015ue)],
already manage internal client-side state by subscribing to a stream of events representing user
input or responses from a server, structured similarly to event sourcing (see
[“Event Sourcing”](ch11.html#sec_stream_event_sourcing)). It would be very natural to extend this programming model to also allow a server to push
state-change events into this client-side event pipeline. Thus, state changes could flow through an
end-to-end write path: from the interaction on one device that triggers a state change, via event
logs and through several derived data systems and stream processors, all the way to the user
interface of a person observing the state on another device. These state changes could be propagated
with fairly low delay—say, under one second end to end. 
Some applications, such as instant messaging and online games, already have such a “real-time”
architecture (in the sense of interactions with low delay, not in the sense of
[“Response time guarantees”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_clocks_realtime)). But why don’t we build all applications this way?
