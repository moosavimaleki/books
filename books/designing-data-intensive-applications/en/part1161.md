To perform a computation eagerly and write out its result, as opposed to calculating it on demand
when requested. See [“Aggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views”](ch03.html#sec_storage_materialized_views) and [“Materialization of Intermediate State”](ch10.html#sec_batch_materialize). node

network in order to accomplish some task. normalized 
Structured in such a way that there is no redundancy or duplication. In a normalized database,
when some piece of data changes, you only need to change it in one place, not many copies in many
different places. See [“Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_many_to_many). OLAP

average) over a large number of records. See [“Transaction Processing or Analytics?”](ch03.html#sec_storage_analytics). OLTP 
Online transaction processing. Access pattern characterized by fast queries that read or write a
small number of records, usually indexed by key. See [“Transaction Processing or Analytics?”](ch03.html#sec_storage_analytics).
