For example, such a system could operate distributed across multiple datacenters in a multi-leader
configuration, asynchronously replicating between regions. Any one datacenter can continue operating
independently from the others, because no synchronous cross-region coordination is required. Such a
system would have weak timeliness guarantees—it could not be linearizable without introducing
coordination—but it can still have strong integrity guarantees. 
In this context, serializable transactions are still useful as part of maintaining derived state,
but they can be run at a small scope where they work well
[[8](ch12.html#Helland2007td_ch12)].
Heterogeneous distributed transactions such as XA transactions (see [“Distributed Transactions in Practice”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans))
are not required. Synchronous coordination can still be introduced in places where it is needed (for
example, to enforce strict constraints before an operation from which recovery is not possible), but
there is no need for everything to pay the cost of coordination if only a small part of an
application needs it [[43](ch12.html#Burckhardt2015hv)].
