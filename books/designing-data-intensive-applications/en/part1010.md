### Reasoning about dataflows 
When copies of the same data need to be maintained in several storage systems in order to satisfy
different access patterns, you need to be very clear about the inputs and outputs: where is data
written first, and which representations are derived from which sources? How do you get data into
all the right places, in the right formats? 
For example, you might arrange for data to first be written to a system of record database,
capturing the changes made to that database (see [“Change Data Capture”](ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc)) and then applying the changes
to the search index in the same order. If change data capture (CDC) is the only way of updating the
index, you can be confident that the index is entirely derived from the system of record, and
therefore consistent with it (barring bugs in the software). Writing to the database is the only way
of supplying new input into this system.
