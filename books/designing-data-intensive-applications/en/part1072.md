However, this duplicate suppression only works within the context of a single TCP connection.
Imagine the TCP connection is a client’s connection to a database, and it is currently executing the
transaction in [Example 12-1](#fig_future_non_idempotent). In many databases, a transaction is tied to a client
connection (if the client sends several queries, the database knows that they belong to the same
transaction because they are sent on the same TCP connection). If the client suffers a network
interruption and connection timeout after sending the COMMIT, but before hearing back from the
database server, it does not know whether the transaction has been committed or aborted
([Figure 8-1](ch08.html#fig_distributed_network)). ##### Example 12-1. A nonidempotent transfer of money from one account to another ```
`BEGIN` `TRANSACTION``;`
`UPDATE` `accounts` `SET` `balance` `=` `balance` `+` `11``.``00` `WHERE` `account_id` `=` `1234``;`
`UPDATE` `accounts` `SET` `balance` `=` `balance` `-` `11``.``00` `WHERE` `account_id` `=` `4321``;`
`COMMIT``;`
``` The client can reconnect to the database and retry the transaction, but now it is outside of the
scope of TCP duplicate suppression. Since the transaction in [Example 12-1](#fig_future_non_idempotent) is not
idempotent, it could happen that $22 is transferred instead of the desired $11. Thus, even though
[Example 12-1](#fig_future_non_idempotent) is a standard example for transaction atomicity, it is actually not
correct, and real banks do not work like this
