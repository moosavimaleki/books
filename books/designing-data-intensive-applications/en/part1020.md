### Maintaining derived state 
Batch processing has a quite strong functional flavor (even if the code is not written in a
functional programming language): it encourages deterministic, pure functions whose output depends
only on the input and which have no side effects other than the explicit outputs, treating inputs as
immutable and outputs as append-only. Stream processing is similar, but it extends operators to
allow managed, fault-tolerant state (see [“Rebuilding state after a failure”](ch11.html#sec_stream_state_fault_tolerance)). The principle of deterministic functions with well-defined inputs and outputs is not only good for
fault tolerance (see [“Idempotence”](ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence)), but also simplifies reasoning about the dataflows
in an organization [[7](ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12)]. No matter whether the derived data
is a search index, a statistical model, or a cache, it is helpful to think in terms of data
pipelines that derive one thing from another, pushing state changes in one system through functional
application code and applying the effects to derived systems.
