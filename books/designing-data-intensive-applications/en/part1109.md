
Every system is built for a purpose; every action we take has both intended and unintended
consequences. The purpose may be as simple as making money, but the consequences for the world may
reach far beyond that original purpose. We, the engineers building these systems, have a
responsibility to carefully consider those consequences and to consciously decide what kind of world
we want to live in. We talk about data as an abstract thing, but remember that many datasets are about people: their
behavior, their interests, their identity. We must treat such data with humanity and respect. Users
are humans too, and human dignity is paramount. 
Software development increasingly involves making important ethical choices. There are guidelines to
help software engineers navigate these issues, such as the ACMâ€™s Software Engineering Code of Ethics
and Professional Practice [[77](ch12.html#ACMEthics)], but they are
rarely discussed, applied, and enforced in practice. As a result, engineers and product managers
sometimes take a very cavalier attitude to privacy and potential negative consequences of their
products [[78](ch12.html#Chollet2016bo),
[79](ch12.html#Perisic2016zo), [80](ch12.html#Naughton2016qk)].
