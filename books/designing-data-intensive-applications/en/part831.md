If the partitioning is done correctly, you can be sure that all the records you might want to join
are located in the same numbered partition, and so it is sufficient for each mapper to only read one
partition from each of the input datasets. This has the advantage that each mapper can load a
smaller amount of data into its hash table. This approach only works if both of the joinâ€™s inputs have the same number of partitions, with
records assigned to partitions based on the same key and the same hash function. If the inputs are
generated by prior MapReduce jobs that already perform this grouping, then this can be a reasonable
assumption to make. Partitioned hash joins are known as bucketed map joins in Hive
[[37](ch10.html#Grover2015tl)]. ### Map-side merge joins 
Another variant of a map-side join applies if the input datasets are not only partitioned in the
same way, but also sorted based on the same key. In this case, it does not matter whether the
inputs are small enough to fit in memory, because a mapper can perform the same merging operation
that would normally be done by a reducer: reading both input files incrementally, in order of
ascending key, and matching records with the same key.
