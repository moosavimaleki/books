On the other hand, you could imagine precomputing the search results for all possible queries. In
that case, you would have less work to do on the read path: no Boolean logic, just find the results
for your query and return them. However, the write path would be a lot more expensive: the set of
possible search queries that could be asked is infinite, and thus precomputing all possible search
results would require infinite time and storage space. That wouldnâ€™t work so
well.[iii](ch12.html#idm140605755552608) Another option would be to precompute the search results for only a fixed set of the most common
queries, so that they can be served quickly without having to go to the index. The uncommon queries
can still be served from the index. This would generally be called a cache of common queries,
although we could also call it a materialized view, as it would need to be updated when new
documents appear that should be included in the results of one of the common queries.
