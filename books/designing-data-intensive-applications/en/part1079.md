Transactions are expensive, especially when they involve heterogeneous storage technologies (see
[“Distributed Transactions in Practice”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans)). When we refuse to use distributed transactions because they are too
expensive, we end up having to reimplement fault-tolerance mechanisms in application code. As
numerous examples throughout this book have shown, reasoning about concurrency and partial failure
is difficult and counterintuitive, and so I suspect that most application-level mechanisms do not
work correctly. The consequence is lost or corrupted data. For these reasons, I think it is worth exploring fault-tolerance abstractions that make it easy to
provide application-specific end-to-end correctness properties, but also maintain good performance
and good operational characteristics in a large-scale distributed environment. ## Enforcing Constraints 
Let’s think about correctness in the context of the ideas around unbundling databases
([“Unbundling Databases”](#sec_future_unbundling)). We saw that end-to-end duplicate suppression can be achieved with a
request ID that is passed all the way from the client to the database that records the write. What
about other kinds of constraints?
