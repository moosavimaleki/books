
However, in a system that stores friendship status in one place and messages in another place, that
ordering dependency between the unfriend event and the message-send event may be lost. If the
causal dependency is not captured, a service that sends notifications about new messages may process
the message-send event before the unfriend event, and thus incorrectly send a notification to
the ex-partner. In this example, the notifications are effectively a join between the messages and the friend list,
making it related to the timing issues of joins that we discussed previously (see
[“Time-dependence of joins”](ch11.html#sec_stream_join_time)). Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a simple answer to this problem
[[2](ch12.html#Ajoux2015wh_ch12),
[3](ch12.html#Helland2009vd)].
Starting points include: *  
Logical timestamps can provide total ordering without coordination (see
[“Sequence Number Ordering”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_timestamps)), so they may help in cases where total order broadcast is not
feasible. However, they still require recipients to handle events that are delivered out of order,
and they require additional metadata to be passed around.
