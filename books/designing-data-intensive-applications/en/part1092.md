This combination of mechanisms seems to me a very promising direction for building fault-tolerant
applications in the future. ### Loosely interpreted constraints 
As discussed previously, enforcing a uniqueness constraint requires consensus, typically implemented by
funneling all events in a particular partition through a single node. This limitation is unavoidable
if we want the traditional form of uniqueness constraint, and stream processing cannot avoid it. However, another thing to realize is that many real applications can actually get away with much
weaker notions of uniqueness: *  
If two people concurrently register the same username or book the same seat, you can send one of
them a message to apologize, and ask them to choose a different one. This kind of change to correct
a mistake is called a compensating transaction [[59](ch12.html#Gray1981wi_ch12),
[60](ch12.html#GarciaMolina1987ca_ch12)]. *  If customers order more items than you have in your warehouse, you can order in more stock,
apologize to customers for the delay, and offer them a discount. This is actually the same as what
youâ€™d have to do if, say, a forklift truck ran over some of the items in your warehouse, leaving you
with fewer items in stock than you thought you had [[61](ch12.html#Helland2007tp)]. Thus, the apology
workflow already needs to be part of your business processes anyway, and so it might be
unnecessary to require a linearizable constraint on the number of items in stock.
