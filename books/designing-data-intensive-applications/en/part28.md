When you combine several tools in order to provide a service, the serviceâ€™s interface or application
programming interface (API) usually hides those implementation details from clients. Now you have
essentially created a new, special-purpose data system from smaller, general-purpose components.
Your composite data system may provide certain guarantees: e.g., that the cache will be correctly
invalidated or updated on writes so that outside clients see consistent results. You are now not
only an application developer, but also a data system designer. If you are designing a data system or service, a lot of tricky questions arise. How do you ensure
that the data remains correct and complete, even when things go wrong internally? How do you provide
consistently good performance to clients, even when parts of your system are degraded? How do you
scale to handle an increase in load? What does a good API for the service look like?
