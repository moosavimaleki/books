### Correctness of dataflow systems 
ACID transactions usually provide both timeliness (e.g., linearizability) and integrity (e.g.,
atomic commit) guarantees. Thus, if you approach application correctness from the point of view of
ACID transactions, the distinction between timeliness and integrity is fairly inconsequential. On the other hand, an interesting property of the event-based dataflow systems that we have
discussed in this chapter is that they decouple timeliness and integrity. When processing event
streams asynchronously, there is no guarantee of timeliness, unless you explicitly build consumers
that wait for a message to arrive before returning. But integrity is in fact central to streaming
systems. Exactly-once or effectively-once semantics (see [“Fault Tolerance”](ch11.html#sec_stream_fault_tolerance)) is a mechanism
for preserving integrity. If an event is lost, or if an event takes effect twice, the integrity of a
data system could be violated. Thus, fault-tolerant message delivery and duplicate suppression
(e.g., idempotent operations) are important for maintaining the integrity of a data system in the
face of faults.
