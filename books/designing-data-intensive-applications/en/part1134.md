We should allow each individual to maintain their privacy—i.e., their control over own data—and not
steal that control from them through surveillance. Our individual right to control our data is like
the natural environment of a national park: if we don’t explicitly protect and care for it, it will
be destroyed. It will be the tragedy of the commons, and we will all be worse off for it. Ubiquitous
surveillance is not inevitable—we are still able to stop it. 
How exactly we might achieve this is an open question. To begin with, we should not retain data
forever, but purge it as soon as it is no longer needed
[[111](ch12.html#Ceglowski2015vw),
[112](ch12.html#Thielman2016bt)]. Purging data runs counter to the idea of immutability (see
[“Limitations of immutability”](ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability_limitations)), but that issue can be solved. A promising approach I see
is to enforce access control through cryptographic protocols, rather than merely by policy
[[113](ch12.html#Friedersdorf2014yc),
[114](ch12.html#Rogaway2015uc)].
Overall, culture and attitude changes will be necessary.
