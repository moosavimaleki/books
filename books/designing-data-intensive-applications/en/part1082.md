### Uniqueness in log-based messaging 
The log ensures that all consumers see messages in the same order—a guarantee that is formally known
as total order broadcast and is equivalent to consensus (see [“Total Order Broadcast”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_total_order)). In
the unbundled database approach with log-based messaging, we can use a very similar approach to
enforce uniqueness constraints. 
A stream processor consumes all the messages in a log partition sequentially on a single thread (see
[“Logs compared to traditional messaging”](ch11.html#sec_stream_logs_vs_messaging)). Thus, if the log is partitioned based on the value that needs to
be unique, a stream processor can unambiguously and deterministically decide which one of several
conflicting operations came first. For example, in the case of several users trying to claim the
same username [[57](ch12.html#Yarmula2016wv)]: 1.  Every request for a username is encoded as a message, and appended to a partition determined by
the hash of the username. 2.  
A stream processor sequentially reads the requests in the log, using a local database to keep
track of which usernames are taken. For every request for a username that is available, it
records the name as taken and emits a success message to an output stream. For every request for
a username that is already taken, it emits a rejection message to an output stream.
