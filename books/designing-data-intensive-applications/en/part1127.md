This kind of large-scale transfer of privacy rights from individuals to corporations is historically
unprecedented [[99](ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd)]. Surveillance has always
existed, but it used to be expensive and manual, not scalable and automated. Trust relationships
have always existed, for example between a patient and their doctor, or between a defendant and
their attorney—but in these cases the use of data has been strictly governed by ethical, legal,
and regulatory constraints. Internet services have made it much easier to amass huge amounts of
sensitive information without meaningful consent, and to use it at
massive scale without users understanding what is happening to their private data. ### Data as assets and power 
Since behavioral data is a byproduct of users interacting with a service, it is sometimes called
“data exhaust”—suggesting that the data is worthless waste material. Viewed this way, behavioral
and predictive analytics can be seen as a form of recycling that extracts value from data that would
have otherwise been thrown away.
