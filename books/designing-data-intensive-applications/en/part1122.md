### Consent and freedom of choice 
We might assert that users voluntarily choose to use a service that tracks their activity, and they
have agreed to the terms of service and privacy policy, so they consent to data collection. We might
even claim that users are receiving a valuable service in return for the data they provide, and that
the tracking is necessary in order to provide the service. Undoubtedly, social networks, search
engines, and various other free online services are valuable to users—but there are problems with
this argument. Users have little knowledge of what data they are feeding into our databases, or how it is retained
and processed—and most privacy policies do more to obscure than to illuminate. Without understanding
what happens to their data, users cannot give any meaningful consent. Often, data from one user also
says things about other people who are not users of the service and who have not agreed to any
terms. The derived datasets that we discussed in this part of the book—in which data from the entire
user base may have been combined with behavioral tracking and external data sources—are precisely
the kinds of data of which users cannot have any meaningful understanding.
