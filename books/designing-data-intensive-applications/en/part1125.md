When data is extracted from people through surveillance infrastructure, privacy rights are not
necessarily eroded, but rather transferred to the data collector. Companies that acquire data
essentially say “trust us to do the right thing with your data,” which means that the right to
decide what to reveal and what to keep secret is transferred from the individual to the company. The companies in turn choose to keep much of the outcome of this surveillance secret, because to
reveal it would be perceived as creepy, and would harm their business model (which relies on knowing
more about people than other companies do). Intimate information about users is only revealed
indirectly, for example in the form of tools for targeting advertisements to specific groups of
people (such as those suffering from a particular illness). Even if particular users cannot be personally reidentified from the bucket of people targeted by a
particular ad, they have lost their agency about the disclosure of some intimate information, such
as whether they suffer from some illness. It is not the user who decides what is revealed to whom on
the basis of their personal preferences—it is the company that exercises the privacy right with
the goal of maximizing its profit.
