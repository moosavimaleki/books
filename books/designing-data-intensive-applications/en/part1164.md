shared-nothing 
An architecture in which independent nodes—each with their own CPUs, memory, and disks—are
connected via a conventional network, in contrast to shared-memory or shared-disk architectures.
See the introduction to [Part II](part02.html#part_distributed_data). skew 1.  
Imbalanced load across partitions, such that some partitions have lots of requests or data, and
others have much less. Also known as hot spots. See [“Skewed Workloads and Relieving Hot Spots”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_skew) and
[“Handling skew”](ch10.html#sec_batch_skew). 2.  A timing anomaly that causes events to appear in an unexpected, nonsequential order. See the
discussions of read skew in [“Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_snapshot_isolation), write skew in
[“Write Skew and Phantoms”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_write_skew), and clock skew in [“Timestamps for ordering events”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_lww). split brain 
A scenario in which two nodes simultaneously believe themselves to be the leader, and which may
cause system guarantees to be violated. See [“Handling Node Outages”](ch05.html#sec_replication_failover) and
[“The Truth Is Defined by the Majority”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_majority). stored procedure 
A way of encoding the logic of a transaction such that it can be entirely executed on a database
server, without communicating back and forth with a client during the transaction. See
[“Actual Serial Execution”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_serial).
