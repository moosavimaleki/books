partitioning 
Splitting up a large dataset or computation that is too big for a single machine into smaller
parts and spreading them across several machines. Also known as sharding. See
[Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch_partitioning). percentile 
A way of measuring the distribution of values by counting how many values are above or below some
threshold. For example, the 95th percentile response time during some period is the time t such
that 95% of requests in that period complete in less than t, and 5% take longer than t. See
[“Describing Performance”](ch01.html#sec_introduction_percentiles). primary key 
A value (typically a number or a string) that uniquely identifies a record. In many applications,
primary keys are generated by the system when a record is created (e.g., sequentially or randomly);
they are not usually set by users. See also secondary index. quorum 
The minimum number of nodes that need to vote on an operation before it can be considered
successful. See [“Quorums for reading and writing”](ch05.html#sec_replication_quorum_condition).
