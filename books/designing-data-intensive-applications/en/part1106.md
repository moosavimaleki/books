
Having continuous end-to-end integrity checks gives you increased confidence about the correctness
of your systems, which in turn allows you to move faster
[[70](ch12.html#Stokes2016ni)]. Like automated testing, auditing
increases the chances that bugs will be found quickly, and thus reduces the risk that a change to
the system or a new storage technology will cause damage. If you are not afraid of making changes,
you can much better evolve an application to meet changing requirements. ### Tools for auditable data systems 
At present, not many data systems make auditability a top-level concern. Some applications implement
their own audit mechanisms, for example by logging all changes to a separate audit table, but
guaranteeing the integrity of the audit log and the database state is still difficult. A transaction
log can be made tamper-proof by periodically signing it with a hardware security module, but that
does not guarantee that the right transactions went into the log in the first place.
