### The end-to-end argument 
This scenario of suppressing duplicate transactions is just one example of a more general principle
called the end-to-end argument, which was articulated by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark in 1984
[[55](ch12.html#Saltzer1984do_ch12)]: The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and
help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communication system. Therefore, providing
that questioned function as a feature of the communication system itself is not possible. (Sometimes
an incomplete version of the function provided by the communication system may be useful as a
performance enhancement.) In our example, the function in question was duplicate suppression. We saw that TCP suppresses
duplicate packets at the TCP connection level, and some stream processors provide so-called
exactly-once semantics at the message processing level, but that is not enough to prevent a user
from submitting a duplicate request if the first one times out.  By themselves, TCP, database
transactions, and stream processors cannot entirely rule out these duplicates. Solving the problem
requires an end-to-end solution: a transaction identifier that is passed all the way from the
end-user client to the database.
