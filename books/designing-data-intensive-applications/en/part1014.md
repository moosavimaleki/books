### The limits of total ordering 
With systems that are small enough, constructing a totally ordered event log is entirely feasible
(as demonstrated by the popularity of databases with single-leader replication, which construct
precisely such a log). However, as systems are scaled toward bigger and more complex workloads,
limitations begin to emerge: *  In most cases, constructing a totally ordered log requires all events to pass through a single
leader node that decides on the ordering. If the throughput of events is greater than a single
machine can handle, you need to partition it across multiple machines (see [“Partitioned Logs”](ch11.html#sec_stream_log)).
The order of events in two different partitions is then ambiguous. *  
If the servers are spread across multiple geographically distributed datacenters, for example in
order to tolerate an entire datacenter going offline, you typically have a separate leader in each
datacenter, because network delays make synchronous cross-datacenter coordination inefficient (see
[“Multi-Leader Replication”](ch05.html#sec_replication_multi_leader)). This implies an undefined ordering of events that originate in
two different datacenters.
