
One of the most effective approaches is to make the operation idempotent (see
[“Idempotence”](ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence)); that is, to ensure that it has the same effect, no matter whether it is
executed once or multiple times. However, taking an operation that is not naturally idempotent and
making it idempotent requires some effort and care: you may need to maintain some additional
metadata (such as the set of operation IDs that have updated a value), and ensure fencing when
failing over from one node to another (see [“The leader and the lock”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_lock_fencing)). ### Duplicate suppression 
The same pattern of needing to suppress duplicates occurs in many other places besides stream
processing. For example, TCP uses sequence numbers on packets to put them in the correct order at
the recipient, and to determine whether any packets were lost or duplicated on the network. Any lost
packets are retransmitted and any duplicates are removed by the TCP stack before it hands the data
to an application.
