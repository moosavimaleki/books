# Chapter 12. The Future of Data Systems

# Chapter 12. The Future of Data Systems If a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of
its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship entrusted to
him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation. (Often quoted as: If the highest aim of a captain was the preserve his ship, he would keep it in
port forever.) St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (1265â€“1274) ![](assets/ch12-map-ebook.png) 
So far, this book has been mostly about describing things as they are at present. In this final
chapter, we will shift our perspective toward the future and discuss how things should be: I will
propose some ideas and approaches that, I believe, may fundamentally improve the ways we design and
build applications. Opinions and speculation about the future are of course subjective, and so I will use the first
person in this chapter when writing about my personal opinions. You are welcome to disagree with
them and form your own opinions, but I hope that the ideas in this chapter will at least be a
starting point for a productive discussion and bring some clarity to concepts that are often
confused.
