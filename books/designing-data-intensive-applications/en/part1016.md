### Ordering events to capture causality 
In cases where there is no causal link between events, the lack of a total order is not a big
problem, since concurrent events can be ordered arbitrarily. Some other cases are easy to handle:
for example, when there are multiple updates of the same object, they can be totally ordered by
routing all updates for a particular object ID to the same log partition. However, causal
dependencies sometimes arise in more subtle ways (see also [“Ordering and Causality”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_causality)). 
For example, consider a social networking service, and two users who were in a relationship but have
just broken up. One of the users removes the other as a friend, and then sends a message to their
remaining friends complaining about their ex-partner. The user’s intention is that their ex-partner
should not see the rude message, since the message was sent after the friend status was revoked.
