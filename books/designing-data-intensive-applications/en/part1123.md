Moreover, data is extracted from users through a one-way process, not a relationship with true
reciprocity, and not a fair value exchange. There is no dialog, no option for users to negotiate how
much data they provide and what service they receive in return: the relationship between the service
and the user is very asymmetric and one-sided. The terms are set by the service, not by the user
[[99](ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd)]. For a user who does not consent to surveillance, the only real alternative is simply not to use a
service. But this choice is not free either: if a service is so popular that it is “regarded by most
people as essential for basic social participation”
[[99](ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd)], then it is not reasonable to expect
people to opt out of this service—using it is de facto mandatory. For example, in most Western
social communities, it has become the norm to carry a smartphone, to use Facebook for socializing,
and to use Google for finding information. Especially when a service has network effects, there is a
social cost to people choosing not to use it.
