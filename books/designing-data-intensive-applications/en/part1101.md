### Don’t just blindly trust what they promise 
With both hardware and software not always living up to the ideal that we would like them to be, it
seems that data corruption is inevitable sooner or later. Thus, we should at least have a way of
finding out if data has been corrupted so that we can fix it and try to track down the source of the
error. Checking the integrity of data is known as auditing. As discussed in [“Advantages of immutable events”](ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability_pros), auditing is not just for financial applications.
However, auditability is highly important in finance precisely because everyone knows that mistakes
happen, and we all recognize the need to be able to detect and fix problems. 
Mature systems similarly tend to consider the possibility of unlikely things going wrong, and manage
that risk. For example, large-scale storage systems such as HDFS and Amazon S3 do not fully trust
disks: they run background processes that continually read back files, compare them to other
replicas, and move files from one disk to another, in order to mitigate the risk of silent
corruption [[67](ch12.html#Chen2016rq)].
