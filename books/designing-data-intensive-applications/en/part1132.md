We should try to make them proud. ### Legislation and self-regulation 
Data protection laws might be able to help preserve individuals’ rights. For example, the 1995
European Data Protection Directive states that personal data must be “collected for specified,
explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those
purposes,” and furthermore that data must be “adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to
the purposes for which they are collected”
[[107](ch12.html#DataProtectionDirective1995)]. However, it is doubtful whether this legislation is effective in today’s internet context
[[108](ch12.html#VanAlsenoy2016wb)]. These rules run directly counter
to the philosophy of Big Data, which is to maximize data collection, to combine it with other
datasets, to experiment and to explore in order to generate new insights. Exploration means using
data for unforeseen purposes, which is the opposite of the “specified and explicit” purposes for
which the user gave their consent (if we can meaningfully speak of consent at all
[[109](ch12.html#Rhoen2016ff)]). Updated
regulations are now being developed [[89](ch12.html#Goodman2016vd)].
