If you want to ensure that the payer account is not overdrawn by this transfer, you can additionally
have a stream processor (partitioned by payer account number) that maintains account balances and
validates transactions. Only valid transactions would then be placed in the request log in step 1. By breaking down the multi-partition transaction into two differently partitioned stages and using
the end-to-end request ID, we have achieved the same correctness property (every request is applied
exactly once to both the payer and payee accounts), even in the presence of faults, and without using
an atomic commit protocol. The idea of using multiple differently partitioned stages is similar to
what we discussed in [“Multi-partition data processing”](#sec_future_unbundled_multi_partition) (see also [“Concurrency control”](ch11.html#sec_stream_concurrency)). ## Timeliness and Integrity 
A convenient property of transactions is that they are typically linearizable (see
[“Linearizability”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_linearizability)): that is, a writer waits until a transaction is committed, and
thereafter its writes are immediately visible to all readers.
