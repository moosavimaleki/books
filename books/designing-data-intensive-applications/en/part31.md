The things that can go wrong are called faults, and systems that anticipate faults and can cope
with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient. The former term is slightly misleading: it
suggests that we could make a system tolerant of every possible kind of fault, which in reality is
not feasible.  If the entire planet Earth (and all servers on it) were
swallowed by a black hole, tolerance of that fault would require web hosting in spaceâ€”good luck
getting that budget item approved. So it only makes sense to talk about tolerating certain types
of faults. 
Note that a fault is not the same as a failure
[[2](ch01.html#Heimerdinger1992vn)]. A fault is usually defined as one component of the system
deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the
required service to the user. It is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero;
therefore it is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing
failures. In this book we cover several techniques for building reliable systems from unreliable
parts.
