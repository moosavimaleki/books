Companies that collect lots of data about people oppose regulation as being a burden and a hindrance
to innovation. To some extent that opposition is justified. For example, when sharing medical data,
there are clear risks to privacy, but there are also potential opportunities: how many deaths could
be prevented if data analysis was able to help us achieve better diagnostics or find better
treatments [[110](ch12.html#Leber2016xy)]? Over-regulation may prevent such breakthroughs. It is difficult to balance such
potential opportunities with the risks [[105](ch12.html#Ulbricht2016gh)]. 
Fundamentally, I think we need a culture shift in the tech industry with regard to personal data. We
should stop regarding users as metrics to be optimized, and remember that they are humans who
deserve respect, dignity, and agency. We should self-regulate our data collection and processing
practices in order to establish and maintain the trust of the people who depend on our software
[[111](ch12.html#Ceglowski2015vw)]. And we should take it upon ourselves to educate end users about how their
data is used, rather than keeping them in the dark.
