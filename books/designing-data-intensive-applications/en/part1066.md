Another example of this pattern occurs in fraud prevention: in order to assess the risk of whether a
particular purchase event is fraudulent, you can examine the reputation scores of the user’s IP
address, email address, billing address, shipping address, and so on. Each of these reputation
databases is itself partitioned, and so collecting the scores for a particular purchase event
requires a sequence of joins with differently partitioned datasets
[[49](ch12.html#Bice2016vl)]. The internal query execution graphs of MPP databases have similar characteristics (see
[“Comparing Hadoop to Distributed Databases”](ch10.html#sec_batch_mr_vs_db)). If you need to perform this kind of multi-partition join, it is probably
simpler to use a database that provides this feature than to implement it using a stream processor.
However, treating queries as streams provides an option for implementing large-scale applications
that run against the limits of conventional off-the-shelf solutions. # Aiming for Correctness 
With stateless services that only read data, it is not a big deal if something goes wrong: you can
fix the bug and restart the service, and everything returns to normal. Stateful systems such as
databases are not so simple: they are designed to remember things forever (more or less), so if
something goes wrong, the effects also potentially last forever—which means they require more
careful thought [[50](ch12.html#Majors2016wo)].
