##### Example 12-2. Suppressing duplicate requests using a unique ID ```
`ALTER` `TABLE` `requests` `ADD` `UNIQUE` `(``request_id``);`

`BEGIN` `TRANSACTION``;`

`INSERT` `INTO` `requests`
  `(``request_id``,` `from_account``,` `to_account``,` `amount``)`
  `VALUES``(``'0286FDB8-D7E1-423F-B40B-792B3608036C'``,` `4321``,` `1234``,` `11``.``00``);`

`UPDATE` `accounts` `SET` `balance` `=` `balance` `+` `11``.``00` `WHERE` `account_id` `=` `1234``;`
`UPDATE` `accounts` `SET` `balance` `=` `balance` `-` `11``.``00` `WHERE` `account_id` `=` `4321``;`

`COMMIT``;`
``` [Example 12-2](#fig_future_request_id) relies on a uniqueness constraint on the request_id column. If a
transaction attempts to insert an ID that already exists, the INSERT fails and the transaction is
aborted, preventing it from taking effect twice. Relational databases can generally maintain a
uniqueness constraint correctly, even at weak isolation levels (whereas an application-level
check-then-insert may fail under nonserializable isolation, as discussed in
[“Write Skew and Phantoms”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_write_skew)). 
Besides suppressing duplicate requests, the requests table in [Example 12-2](#fig_future_request_id) acts as a
kind of event log, hinting in the direction of event sourcing (see [“Event Sourcing”](ch11.html#sec_stream_event_sourcing)).
The updates to the account balances don’t actually have to happen in the same transaction as the
insertion of the event, since they are redundant and could be derived from the request event in a
downstream consumer—as long as the event is processed exactly once, which can again be enforced
using the request ID.
