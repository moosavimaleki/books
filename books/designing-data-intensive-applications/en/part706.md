Note that unlike Lamport timestamps, the numbers you get from incrementing the linearizable register
form a sequence with no gaps. Thus, if a node has delivered message 4 and receives an incoming
message with a sequence number of 6, it knows that it must wait for message 5 before it can deliver
message 6. The same is not the case with Lamport timestampsâ€”in fact, this is the key difference
between total order broadcast and timestamp ordering. How hard could it be to make a linearizable integer with an atomic increment-and-get operation? As
usual, if things never failed, it would be easy: you could just keep it in a variable on one node.
The problem lies in handling the situation when network connections to that node are interrupted,
and restoring the value when that node fails
[[59](ch09.html#Balakrishnan2012wm)].
In general, if you think hard enough about linearizable sequence number generators, you inevitably
end up with a consensus algorithm.
