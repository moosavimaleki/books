However, depending on a company’s business model, tracking often doesn’t stop there. If the service
is funded through advertising, the advertisers are the actual customers, and the users’ interests
take second place. Tracking data becomes more detailed, analyses become further-reaching, and data
is retained for a long time in order to build up detailed profiles of each person for marketing
purposes. Now the relationship between the company and the user whose data is being collected starts looking
quite different. The user is given a free service and is coaxed into engaging with it as much as
possible. The tracking of the user serves not primarily that individual, but rather the needs of
the advertisers who are funding the service. I think this relationship can be appropriately
described with a word that has more sinister connotations: surveillance. ### Surveillance 
As a thought experiment, try replacing the word data with surveillance, and observe if common
phrases still sound so good

How about this: “In our surveillance-driven organization we collect real-time surveillance streams
and store them in our surveillance warehouse. Our surveillance scientists use advanced analytics and
surveillance processing in order to derive new insights.”
