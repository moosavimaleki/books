I fear that the culture of ACID databases has led us toward developing applications on the basis of
blindly trusting technology (such as a transaction mechanism), and neglecting any sort of
auditability in the process. Since the technology we trusted worked well enough most of the time,
auditing mechanisms were not deemed worth the investment. But then the database landscape changed: weaker consistency guarantees became the norm under the
banner of NoSQL, and less mature storage technologies became widely used. Yet, because the audit
mechanisms had not been developed, we continued building applications on the basis of blind trust,
even though this approach had now become more dangerous. Let’s think for a moment about designing
for auditability. ### Designing for auditability 
If a transaction mutates several objects in a database, it is difficult to tell after the fact what
that transaction means. Even if you capture the transaction logs (see [“Change Data Capture”](ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc)), the
insertions, updates, and deletions in various tables do not necessarily give a clear picture of
why those mutations were performed. The invocation of the application logic that decided on those
mutations is transient and cannot be reproduced.
