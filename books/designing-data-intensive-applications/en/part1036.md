
The traditional approach to synchronizing writes requires distributed transactions across
heterogeneous storage systems [[18](ch12.html#Stonebraker2015wu)], which
I think is the wrong solution (see [“Derived data versus distributed transactions”](#sec_future_derived_vs_transactions)). Transactions within a
single storage or stream processing system are feasible, but when data crosses the boundary between
different technologies, I believe that an asynchronous event log with idempotent writes is a much
more robust and practical approach. For example, distributed transactions are used within some stream processors to achieve exactly-once
semantics (see [“Atomic commit revisited”](ch11.html#sec_stream_atomic_commit)), and this can work quite well. However, when a
transaction would need to involve systems written by different groups of people (e.g., when data is
written from a stream processor to a distributed key-value store or search index), the lack of a
standardized transaction protocol makes integration much harder. An ordered log of events with
idempotent consumers (see [“Idempotence”](ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence)) is a much simpler abstraction, and thus much
more feasible to implement across heterogeneous systems
