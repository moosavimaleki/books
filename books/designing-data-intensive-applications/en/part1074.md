In this case, the user will probably be shown an error message, and they may retry manually. Web
browsers warn, “Are you sure you want to submit this form again?”—and the user says yes, because
they wanted the operation to happen. (The Post/Redirect/Get pattern
[[54](ch12.html#Jouravlev2004wh)] avoids this warning message in normal
operation, but it doesn’t help if the POST request times out.) From the web server’s point of view
the retry is a separate request, and from the database’s point of view it is a separate transaction.
The usual deduplication mechanisms don’t help. ### Operation identifiers 
To make the operation idempotent through several hops of network communication, it is not sufficient
to rely just on a transaction mechanism provided by a database—you need to consider the end-to-end
flow of the request. For example, you could generate a unique identifier for an operation (such as a UUID) and include it
as a hidden form field in the client application, or calculate a hash of all the relevant form
fields to derive the operation ID [[3](ch12.html#Helland2009vd)]. If
the web browser submits the POST request twice, the two requests will have the same operation ID.
You can then pass that operation ID all the way through to the database and check that you only ever
execute one operation with a given ID, as shown in [Example 12-2](#fig_future_request_id).
