# Scope of This Book This book does not attempt to give detailed instructions on how to install or use specific software
packages or APIs, since there is already plenty of documentation for those things. Instead we
discuss the various principles and trade-offs that are fundamental to data systems, and we explore
the different design decisions taken by different products. In the ebook editions we have included links to the full text of online resources. All links were verified at the time of publication, but unfortunately links tend to break frequently due to the nature of the web. If you come across a broken link, or if you are reading a print copy of this book, you can look up references using a search engine. For academic papers, you can search for the title in Google Scholar to find open-access PDF files. Alternatively, you can find all of the references at [https://github.com/ept/ddia-references](https://github.com/ept/ddia-references), where we maintain up-to-date links.
