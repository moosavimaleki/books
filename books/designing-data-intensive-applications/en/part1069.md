While the traditional transaction approach is not going away, I also believe it is not the last word
in making applications correct and resilient to faults. In this section I will suggest some ways of
thinking about correctness in the context of dataflow architectures. ## The End-to-End Argument for Databases Just because an application uses a data system that provides comparatively strong safety properties,
such as serializable transactions, that does not mean the application is guaranteed to be free from
data loss or corruption. For example, if an application has a bug that causes it to write incorrect
data, or delete data from a database, serializable transactions aren’t going to save you. This example may seem frivolous, but it is worth taking seriously: application bugs occur, and
people make mistakes. I used this example in [“State, Streams, and Immutability”](ch11.html#sec_stream_immutability) to argue in favor of
immutable and append-only data, because it is easier to recover from such mistakes if you remove the
ability of faulty code to destroy good data.
