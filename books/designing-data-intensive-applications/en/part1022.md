
When maintaining derived data, batch and stream processing are both useful. Stream processing allows
changes in the input to be reflected in derived views with low delay, whereas batch processing
allows large amounts of accumulated historical data to be reprocessed in order to derive new views
onto an existing dataset. 
In particular, reprocessing existing data provides a good mechanism for maintaining a system,
evolving it to support new features and changed requirements (see [Chapter 4](ch04.html#ch_encoding)). Without
reprocessing, schema evolution is limited to simple changes like adding a new optional field to a
record, or adding a new type of record. This is the case both in a schema-on-write and in a
schema-on-read context (see [“Schema flexibility in the document model”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_schema_flexibility)). On the other hand, with
reprocessing it is possible to restructure a dataset into a completely different model in order to
better serve new requirements. ##### Schema Migrations on Railways
