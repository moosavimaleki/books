
In slogan form: violations of timeliness are “eventual consistency,” whereas violations of integrity
are “perpetual inconsistency.” I am going to assert that in most applications, integrity is much more important than timeliness.
Violations of timeliness can be annoying and confusing, but violations of integrity can be
catastrophic. For example, on your credit card statement, it is not surprising if a transaction that you made
within the last 24 hours does not yet appear—it is normal that these systems have a certain lag.
We know that banks reconcile and settle transactions asynchronously, and timeliness is not very
important here [[3](ch12.html#Helland2009vd)]. However, it would be
very bad if the statement balance was not equal to the sum of the transactions plus the previous
statement balance (an error in the sums), or if a transaction was charged to you but not paid to the
merchant (disappearing money). Such problems would be violations of the integrity of the system.
