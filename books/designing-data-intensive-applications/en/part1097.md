Another way of looking at coordination and constraints: they reduce the number of apologies you have
to make due to inconsistencies, but potentially also reduce the performance and availability of your
system, and thus potentially increase the number of apologies you have to make due to outages. You
cannot reduce the number of apologies to zero, but you can aim to find the best trade-off for your
needs—the sweet spot where there are neither too many inconsistencies nor too many availability
problems. ## Trust, but Verify 
All of our discussion of correctness, integrity, and fault-tolerance has been under the assumption
that certain things might go wrong, but other things won’t. We call these assumptions our system
model (see [“Mapping system models to the real world”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_model_real_world)): for example, we should assume that processes can
crash, machines can suddenly lose power, and the network can arbitrarily delay or drop messages. But
we might also assume that data written to disk is not lost after fsync, that data in memory is not
corrupted, and that the multiplication instruction of our CPU always returns the correct result.
