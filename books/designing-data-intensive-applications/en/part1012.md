
Updating a derived data system based on an event log can often be made deterministic and idempotent
(see [“Idempotence”](ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence)), making it quite easy to recover from faults. ### Derived data versus distributed transactions 
The classic approach for keeping different data systems consistent with each other involves
distributed transactions, as discussed in [“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc). How does the approach of using
derived data systems fare in comparison to distributed transactions? At an abstract level, they achieve a similar goal by different means. Distributed transactions
decide on an ordering of writes by using locks for mutual exclusion (see [“Two-Phase Locking (2PL)”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_2pl)),
while CDC and event sourcing use a log for ordering.  Distributed transactions use atomic commit to
ensure that changes take effect exactly once, while log-based systems are often based on
deterministic retry and idempotence. 
The biggest difference is that transaction systems usually provide linearizability (see
[“Linearizability”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_linearizability)), which implies useful guarantees such as reading your own
writes (see [“Reading Your Own Writes”](ch05.html#sec_replication_ryw)). On the other hand, derived data systems are often updated
asynchronously, and so they do not by default offer the same timing guarantees.
