3.  Further processors consume the streams of credit and debit instructions, deduplicate by request ID,
and apply the changes to the account balances. Steps 1 and 2 are necessary because if the client directly sent the credit and debit instructions,
it would require an atomic commit across those two partitions to ensure that either both or neither
happen. To avoid the need for a distributed transaction, we first durably log the request as a
single message, and then derive the credit and debit instructions from that first message.
Single-object writes are atomic in almost all data systems (see [“Single-object writes”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_single_object)),
and so the request either appears in the log or it doesn’t, without any need for a multi-partition
atomic commit. 
If the stream processor in step 2 crashes, it resumes processing from its last checkpoint. In doing
so, it does not skip any request messages, but it may process requests multiple times and produce
duplicate credit and debit instructions. However, since it is deterministic, it will just produce
the same instructions again, and the processors in step 3 can easily deduplicate them using the
end-to-end request ID.
