Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it’s about making life better for the engineering
and operations teams who need to work with the system. Good abstractions can help reduce complexity
and make the system easier to modify and adapt for new use cases. Good operability means having good
visibility into the system’s health, and having effective ways of managing it. There is unfortunately no easy fix for making applications reliable, scalable, or maintainable.
However, there are certain patterns and techniques that keep reappearing in different kinds of
applications. In the next few chapters we will take a look at some examples of data systems and
analyze how they work toward those goals. Later in the book, in [Part III](part03.html#part_systems), we will look at patterns for systems that consist of
several components working together, such as the one in [Figure 1-1](#fig_introduction_composite). ##### Footnotes [i](ch01.html#idm140605786161136-marker) Defined
