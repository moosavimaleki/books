However, in most programming languages you cannot subscribe to changes in a mutable variable—you can
only read it periodically. Unlike in a spreadsheet, readers of the variable don’t get notified if
the value of the variable changes.  (You can implement such notifications in
your own code—this is known as the observer pattern—but most languages do not have this pattern as
a built-in feature.) 
Databases have inherited this passive approach to mutable data: if you want to find out whether the
content of the database has changed, often your only option is to poll (i.e., to repeat your query
periodically). Subscribing to changes is only just beginning to emerge as a feature (see
[“API support for change streams”](ch11.html#sec_stream_change_api)). ### Dataflow: Interplay between state changes and application code 
Thinking about applications in terms of dataflow implies renegotiating the relationship between
application code and state management. Instead of treating a database as a passive variable that is
manipulated by the application, we think much more about the interplay and collaboration between
state, state changes, and code that processes them. Application code responds to state changes in
one place by triggering state changes in another place.
