Declining to use a service due to its tracking of users is only an option for the small number of
people who are privileged enough to have the time and knowledge to understand its privacy policy,
and who can afford to potentially miss out on social participation or professional opportunities
that may have arisen if they had participated in the service. For people in a less privileged
position, there is no meaningful freedom of choice: surveillance becomes inescapable. ### Privacy and use of data 
Sometimes people claim that “privacy is dead” on the grounds that some users are willing to post all
sorts of things about their lives to social media, sometimes mundane and sometimes deeply personal.
However, this claim is false and rests on a misunderstanding of the word privacy. Having privacy does not mean keeping everything secret; it means having the freedom to choose which
things to reveal to whom, what to make public, and what to keep secret. The right to privacy is a
decision right: it enables each person to decide where they want to be on the spectrum between
secrecy and transparency in each situation [[99](ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd)].
It is an important aspect of a person’s freedom and autonomy.
