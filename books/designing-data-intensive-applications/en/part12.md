If any of the following are true for you, you’ll find this book valuable: *  You want to learn how to make data systems scalable, for example, to support web or mobile apps
with millions of users. *  You need to make applications highly available (minimizing downtime) and operationally robust. *  You are looking for ways of making systems easier to maintain in the long run, even as they grow
and as requirements and technologies change. *  You have a natural curiosity for the way things work and want to know what goes on inside major
websites and online services. This book breaks down the internals of various databases and data
processing systems, and it’s great fun to explore the bright thinking that went into their design. Sometimes, when discussing scalable data systems, people make comments along the lines of, “You’re
not Google or Amazon. Stop worrying about scale and just use a relational database.” There is truth
in that statement: building for scale that you don’t need is wasted effort and may lock you into an
inflexible design. In effect, it is a form of premature optimization. However, it’s also important
to choose the right tool for the job, and different technologies each have their own strengths and
weaknesses. As we shall see, relational databases are important but not the final word on dealing
with data.
