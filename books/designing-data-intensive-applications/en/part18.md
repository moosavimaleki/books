knowledge, combining experience from both academic research and industrial practice. In computing we
tend to be attracted to things that are new and shiny, but I think we have a huge amount to learn
from things that have been done before. This book has over 800 references to articles, blog posts,
talks, documentation, and more, and they have been an invaluable learning resource for me. I am very
grateful to the authors of this material for sharing their knowledge.
