### Web services 
When HTTP is used as the underlying protocol for talking to the service, it is called a web
service. This is perhaps a slight misnomer, because web services are not only used on the web, but
in several different contexts. For example: 1.  A client application running on a user’s device (e.g., a native app on a mobile device, or JavaScript
web app using Ajax) making requests to a service over HTTP. These requests typically go over the
public internet. 2.  One service making requests to another service owned by the same organization, often located
within the same datacenter, as part of a service-oriented/microservices architecture. (Software that supports
this kind of use case is sometimes called middleware.) 3.  One service making requests to a service owned by a different organization, usually via the
internet. This is used for data exchange between different organizations’ backend systems. This
category includes public APIs provided by online services, such as credit card processing
systems, or OAuth for shared access to user data.
