### The end-to-end argument again 
If we cannot fully trust that every individual component of the system will be free from
corruption—that every piece of hardware is fault-free and that every piece of software is
bug-free—then we must at least periodically check the integrity of our data. If we don’t check, we
won’t find out about corruption until it is too late and it has caused some downstream damage, at
which point it will be much harder and more expensive to track down the problem. Checking the integrity of data systems is best done in an end-to-end fashion (see
[“The End-to-End Argument for Databases”](#sec_future_end_to_end)): the more systems we can include in an integrity check, the fewer
opportunities there are for corruption to go unnoticed at some stage of the process. If we can check
that an entire derived data pipeline is correct end to end, then any disks, networks, services, and
algorithms along the path are implicitly included in the check.
