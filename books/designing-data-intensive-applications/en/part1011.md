
Allowing the application to directly write to both the search index and the database introduces the
problem shown in [Figure 11-4](ch11.html#fig_stream_write_order), in which two clients concurrently send conflicting
writes, and the two storage systems process them in a different order. In this case, neither the
database nor the search index is “in charge” of determining the order of writes, and so they may
make contradictory decisions and become permanently inconsistent with each other. If it is possible for you to funnel all user input through a single system that decides on an
ordering for all writes, it becomes much easier to derive other representations of the data by
processing the writes in the same order. This is an application of the state machine replication
approach that we saw in [“Total Order Broadcast”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_total_order). Whether you use change data capture or an
event sourcing log is less important than simply the principle of deciding on a total order.
