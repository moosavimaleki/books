*  A full-text search index is created by applying various natural language processing functions such
as language detection, word segmentation, stemming or lemmatization, spelling correction, and
synonym identification, followed by building a data structure for efficient lookups (such as an
inverted index). *  
In a machine learning system, we can consider the model as being derived from the training data by
applying various feature extraction and statistical analysis functions. When the model is applied
to new input data, the output of the model is derived from the input and the model (and hence,
indirectly, from the training data). *  A cache often contains an aggregation of data in the form in which it is going to be displayed in
a user interface (UI). Populating the cache thus requires knowledge of what fields are referenced
in the UI; changes in the UI may require updating the definition of how the cache is populated and
rebuilding the cache.
