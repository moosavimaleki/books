This application code can do the arbitrary processing that built-in derivation functions in
databases generally don’t provide. Like Unix tools chained by pipes, stream operators can be
composed to build large systems around dataflow. Each operator takes streams of state changes as
input, and produces other streams of state changes as output. ### Stream processors and services 
The currently trendy style of application development involves breaking down functionality into a
set of services that communicate via synchronous network requests such as REST APIs (see
[“Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC”](ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_rpc)). The advantage of such a service-oriented architecture over a single
monolithic application is primarily organizational scalability through loose coupling: different
teams can work on different services, which reduces coordination effort between teams (as long as
the services can be deployed and updated independently). Composing stream operators into dataflow systems has a lot of similar characteristics to the
microservices approach [[40](ch12.html#Stopford2016tk)]. However, the underlying communication
mechanism is very different: one-directional, asynchronous message streams rather than synchronous
request/response interactions.
