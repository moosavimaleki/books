More correct would be to view it the other way round: from an economic point of view, if targeted
advertising is what pays for a service, then behavioral data about people is the service’s core
asset. In this case, the application with which the user interacts is merely a
means to lure users into feeding more and more personal information into the surveillance
infrastructure [[99](ch12.html#Zuboff2015jd)]. The delightful human
creativity and social relationships that often find expression in online services are cynically
exploited by the data extraction machine. The assertion that personal data is a valuable asset is supported by the existence of data brokers,
a shady industry operating in secrecy, purchasing, aggregating, analyzing, inferring, and reselling
intrusive personal data about people, mostly for marketing purposes
[[90](ch12.html#USSenate2013um)].
Startups are valued by their user numbers, by “eyeballs”—i.e., by their surveillance capabilities. 
Because the data is valuable, many people want it. Of course companies want it—that’s why they
collect it in the first place. But governments want to obtain it too: by means of secret deals,
coercion, legal compulsion, or simply stealing it
[[101](ch12.html#Schneier2016tf)].
When a company goes bankrupt, the personal data it has collected is one of the assets that get sold.
Moreover, the data is difficult to secure, so breaches happen disconcertingly often
