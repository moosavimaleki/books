index 
A data structure that lets you efficiently search for all records that have a particular value in
a particular field. See [“Data Structures That Power Your Database”](ch03.html#sec_storage_oltp). isolation 
In the context of transactions, describing the degree to which concurrently executing transactions
can interfere with each other. Serializable isolation provides the strongest guarantees, but
weaker isolation levels are also used. See [“Isolation”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_isolation). join 
To bring together records that have something in common. Most commonly used in the case where one
record has a reference to another (a foreign key, a document reference, an edge in a graph) and a
query needs to get the record that the reference points to. See [“Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_many_to_many)
and [“Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping”](ch10.html#sec_batch_reduce_joins). leader When data or a service is replicated across several nodes, the leader is the designated replica
that is allowed to make changes. A leader may be elected through some protocol, or manually chosen
by an administrator. Also known as the primary or master. See [“Leaders and Followers”](ch05.html#sec_replication_leader).
