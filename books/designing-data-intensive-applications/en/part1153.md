# Glossary ###### Note Please note that the definitions in this glossary are short and simple, intended to convey the core
idea but not the full subtleties of a term. For more detail, please follow the references into
the main text. asynchronous 
Not waiting for something to complete (e.g., sending data over the network to another node), and
not making any assumptions about how long it is going to take. See [“Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Replication”](ch05.html#sec_replication_sync_async),
[“Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Networks”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_sync_networks), and [“System Model and Reality”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_system_model). atomic 1.  
In the context of concurrent operations: describing an operation that appears to take effect
at a single point in time, so another concurrent process can never encounter the operation in
a “half-finished” state. See also isolation. 2.  
In the context of transactions: grouping together a set of writes that must either all be
committed or all be rolled back, even if faults occur. See [“Atomicity”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_atomicity)
and [“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc).
