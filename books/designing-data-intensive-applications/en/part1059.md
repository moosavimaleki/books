### Pushing state changes to clients 
In a typical web page, if you load the page in a web browser and the data subsequently changes on
the server, the browser does not find out about the change until you reload the page. The browser
only reads the data at one point in time, assuming that it is staticâ€”it does not subscribe to
updates from the server. Thus, the state on the device is a stale cache that is not updated unless
you explicitly poll for changes. (HTTP-based feed subscription protocols like RSS are really just a
basic form of polling.) 
More recent protocols have moved beyond the basic request/response pattern of HTTP: server-sent
events (the EventSource API) and WebSockets provide communication channels by which a web browser can
keep an open TCP connection to a server, and the server can actively push messages to the browser as
long as it remains connected. This provides an opportunity for the server to actively inform the
end-user client about any changes to the state it has stored locally, reducing the staleness of the
client-side state.
