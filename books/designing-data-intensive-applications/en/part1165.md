stream process 
A continually running computation that consumes a never-ending stream of events as input, and
derives some output from it. See [Chapter 11](ch11.html#ch_stream). synchronous 
The opposite of asynchronous. system of record 
A system that holds the primary, authoritative version of some data, also known as the source of
truth. Changes are first written here, and other datasets may be derived from the system of
record. See the introduction to [Part III](part03.html#part_systems). timeout 
One of the simplest ways of detecting a fault, namely by observing the lack of a response within
some amount of time. However, it is impossible to know whether a timeout is due to a problem with
the remote node, or an issue in the network. See [“Timeouts and Unbounded Delays”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_queueing). total order 
A way of comparing things (e.g., timestamps) that allows you to always say which one of two things
is greater and which one is lesser. An ordering in which some things are incomparable (you cannot
say which is greater or smaller) is called a partial order. See
[“The causal order is not a total order”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_causal_not_total).
