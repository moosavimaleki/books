### Stateful, offline-capable clients 
I find the idea of a boundary between write and read paths interesting because we can discuss
shifting that boundary and explore what that shift means in practical terms. Let’s look at the idea
in a different context. The huge popularity of web applications in the last two decades has led us to certain assumptions
about application development that are easy to take for granted. In particular, the client/server
model—in which clients are largely stateless and servers have the authority over data—is so
common that we almost forget that anything else exists. However, technology keeps moving on, and I
think it is important to question the status quo from time to time. Traditionally, web browsers have been stateless clients that can only do useful things when you have
an internet connection (just about the only thing you could do offline was to scroll up and down in
a page that you had previously loaded while online). However, recent “single-page” JavaScript web apps
have gained a lot of stateful capabilities, including client-side user interface interaction and
persistent local storage in the web browser. Mobile apps can similarly store a lot of state on the
device and don’t require a round-trip to the server for most user interactions.
