
Thus, I think that most data systems still have something to learn from the features that VisiCalc
already had in 1979 [[34](ch12.html#BricklinVisiCalc)]. The difference from spreadsheets is that today’s
data systems need to be fault-tolerant, scalable, and store data durably. They also need to be able
to integrate disparate technologies written by different groups of people over time, and reuse
existing libraries and services: it is unrealistic to expect all software to be developed using one
particular language, framework, or tool. In this section I will expand on these ideas and explore some ways of building applications around
the ideas of unbundled databases and dataflow. ### Application code as a derivation function 
When one dataset is derived from another, it goes through some kind of transformation function. For
example: *  A secondary index is a kind of derived dataset with a straightforward transformation function: for
each row or document in the base table, it picks out the values in the columns or fields being
indexed, and sorts by those values (assuming a B-tree or SSTable index, which are sorted by key,
as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch03.html#ch_storage)).
