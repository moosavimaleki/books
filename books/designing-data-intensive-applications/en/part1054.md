The derived dataset is the place where the write path and the read path meet, as illustrated in
[Figure 12-1](#fig_future_write_read_paths). It represents a trade-off between the amount of work that needs to
be done at write time and the amount that needs to be done at read time. ### Materialized views and caching 
A full-text search index is a good example: the write path updates the index, and the read path
searches the index for keywords. Both reads and writes need to do some work. Writes need to update
the index entries for all terms that appear in the document. Reads need to search for each of the
words in the query, and apply Boolean logic to find documents that contain all of the words in the
query (an AND operator), or any synonym of each of the words (an OR operator). If you didn’t have an index, a search query would have to scan over all documents (like grep),
which would get very expensive if you had a large number of documents. No index means less work on
the write path (no index to update), but a lot more work on the read path.
