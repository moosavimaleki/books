## Designing Applications Around Dataflow 
The approach of unbundling databases by composing specialized storage and processing systems with
application code is also becoming known as the “database inside-out” approach
[[26](ch12.html#Shapira2016ej)], after the title of a conference talk I
gave in 2014 [[27](ch12.html#Kleppmann2014ht)].
However, calling it a “new architecture” is too grandiose. I see it more as a design pattern, a
starting point for discussion, and we give it a name simply so that we can better talk about it. 
These ideas are not mine; they are simply an amalgamation of other people’s ideas from which I think
we should learn. In particular, there is a lot of overlap with dataflow languages such as Oz
[[28](ch12.html#VanRoy2004th)] and Juttle
[[29](ch12.html#Juttle2016)],
functional reactive programming (FRP) languages such as Elm
[[30](ch12.html#Czaplicki2013ig),
[31](ch12.html#Bainomugisha2013bh)],

and logic programming languages such as Bloom [[32](ch12.html#Alvaro2011wn)]. The term unbundling in this context was proposed by Jay Kreps
[[7](ch12.html#Kreps2013vs_ch12)]. 
Even spreadsheets have dataflow programming capabilities that are miles ahead of most mainstream
programming languages [[33](ch12.html#Hermans2015ws)]. In a spreadsheet, you can put a formula in one cell (for example, the sum of cells
in another column), and whenever any input to the formula changes, the result of the formula is
automatically recalculated. This is exactly what we want at a data system level: when a record in a
database changes, we want any index for that record to be automatically updated, and any cached
views or aggregations that depend on the record to be automatically refreshed. You should not have
to worry about the technical details of how this refresh happens, but be able to simply trust that
it works correctly.
