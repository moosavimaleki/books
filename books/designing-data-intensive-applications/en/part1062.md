The challenge is that the assumption of stateless clients and request/response interactions is very
deeply ingrained in our databases, libraries, frameworks, and protocols. Many datastores support
read and write operations where a request returns one response, but much fewer provide an ability to
subscribe to changes—i.e., a request that returns a stream of responses over time (see
[“API support for change streams”](ch11.html#sec_stream_change_api)). In order to extend the write path all the way to the end user, we would need to fundamentally
rethink the way we build many of these systems: moving away from request/response interaction and
toward publish/subscribe dataflow [[27](ch12.html#Kleppmann2014ht)]. I
think that the advantages of more responsive user interfaces and better offline support would make
it worth the effort. If you are designing data systems, I hope that you will keep in mind the option
of subscribing to changes, not just querying the current state. ### Reads are events too
