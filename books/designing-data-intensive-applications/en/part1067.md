We want to build applications that are reliable and correct (i.e., programs whose semantics are
well defined and understood, even in the face of various faults). For approximately four decades,
the transaction properties of atomicity, isolation, and durability ([Chapter 7](ch07.html#ch_transactions)) have been
the tools of choice for building correct applications. However, those foundations are weaker than
they seem: witness for example the confusion of weak isolation levels (see
[“Weak Isolation Levels”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_isolation_levels)). In some areas, transactions are being abandoned entirely and replaced with models that offer
better performance and scalability, but much messier semantics (see for example
[“Leaderless Replication”](ch05.html#sec_replication_leaderless)). Consistency is often talked about, but poorly defined (see
[“Consistency”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_consistency) and [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ch_consistency)). Some people assert that we should
“embrace weak consistency” for the sake of better availability, while lacking a clear idea of what
that actually means in practice. 
For a topic that is so important, our understanding and our engineering methods are surprisingly
flaky. For example, it is very difficult to determine whether it is safe to run a particular
application at a particular transaction isolation level or replication configuration
[[51](ch12.html#Bernstein2000jk),
[52](ch12.html#Jorwekar2007uq_ch12)].
Often simple solutions appear to work correctly when concurrency is low and there are no faults, but
turn out to have many subtle bugs in more demanding circumstances.
