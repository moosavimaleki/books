
In principle, derived data systems could be maintained synchronously, just like a relational
database updates secondary indexes synchronously within the same transaction as writes to the table
being indexed. However, asynchrony is what makes systems based on event logs robust: it allows a
fault in one part of the system to be contained locally, whereas distributed transactions abort if
any one participant fails, so they tend to amplify failures by spreading them to the rest of the
system (see [“Limitations of distributed transactions”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_trans_limits)). 
We saw in [“Partitioning and Secondary Indexes”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_secondary_indexes) that secondary indexes often cross partition
boundaries. A partitioned system with secondary indexes either needs to send writes to multiple
partitions (if the index is term-partitioned) or send reads to all partitions (if the index is
document-partitioned). Such cross-partition communication is also most reliable and scalable if the
index is maintained asynchronously [[8](ch12.html#Helland2007td_ch12)]
