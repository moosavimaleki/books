If you have a problem such as “I want to store some data and look it up again later,” there is no
one right solution, but many different approaches that are each appropriate in different
circumstances. A software implementation typically has to pick one particular approach. It’s hard
enough to get one code path robust and performing well—trying to do everything in one piece of
software almost guarantees that the implementation will be poor. Thus, the most appropriate choice of software tool also depends on the circumstances. Every piece of
software, even a so-called “general-purpose” database, is designed for a particular usage pattern. Faced with this profusion of alternatives, the first challenge is then to figure out the mapping
between the software products and the circumstances in which they are a good fit. Vendors are
understandably reluctant to tell you about the kinds of workloads for which their software is poorly
suited, but hopefully the previous chapters have equipped you with some questions to ask in order to
read between the lines and better understand the trade-offs.
