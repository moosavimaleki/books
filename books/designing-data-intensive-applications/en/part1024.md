“Reprocessing” the existing tracks in this way, and allowing the old and new versions to exist side by side,
makes it possible to change the gauge gradually over the course of years. Nevertheless, it is an
expensive undertaking, which is why nonstandard gauges still exist today. For example, the BART
system in the San Francisco Bay Area uses a different gauge from the majority of the US. 
Derived views allow gradual evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do not
need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the old schema and the
new schema side by side as two independently derived views onto the same underlying data. You can
then start shifting a small number of users to the new view in order to test its performance and
find any bugs, while most users continue to be routed to the old view. Gradually, you can increase
the proportion of users accessing the new view, and eventually you can drop the old view
