denormalize 
To introduce some amount of redundancy or duplication in a normalized dataset, typically in the
form of a cache or index, in order to speed up reads. A denormalized value is a kind of
precomputed query result, similar to a materialized view. See [“Single-Object and Multi-Object Operations”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_multi_object)
and [“Deriving several views from the same event log”](ch11.html#sec_stream_deriving_views). derived data 
A dataset that is created from some other data through a repeatable process, which you could run
again if necessary. Usually, derived data is needed to speed up a particular kind of read access
to the data. Indexes, caches, and materialized views are examples of derived data. See the
introduction to [Part III](part03.html#part_systems). deterministic 
Describing a function that always produces the same output if you give it the same input. This
means it cannot depend on random numbers, the time of day, network communication, or other
unpredictable things. distributed 
Running on several nodes connected by a network. Characterized by partial failures: some part of
the system may be broken while other parts are still working, and it is often impossible for the
software to know what exactly is broken. See [“Faults and Partial Failures”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_partial_failure).
