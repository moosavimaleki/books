In this section I will attempt to reconcile the two philosophies, in the hope that we can combine
the best of both worlds. ## Composing Data Storage Technologies 
Over the course of this book we have discussed various features provided by databases and how they
work, including: *  Secondary indexes, which allow you to efficiently search for records based on the value of a field
(see [“Other Indexing Structures”](ch03.html#sec_storage_other_indexing)) *  Materialized views, which are a kind of precomputed cache of query results (see
[“Aggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views”](ch03.html#sec_storage_materialized_views)) *  Replication logs, which keep copies of the data on other nodes up to date (see
[“Implementation of Replication Logs”](ch05.html#sec_replication_implementation)) *  Full-text search indexes, which allow keyword search in text (see [“Full-text search and fuzzy indexes”](ch03.html#sec_storage_full_text)) and
which are built into some relational databases
[[1](ch12.html#Belaid2015tl)] In Chapters [10](ch10.html#ch_batch)
and [11](ch11.html#ch_stream),
similar themes emerged. We talked about building full-text search indexes (see
[“The Output of Batch Workflows”](ch10.html#sec_batch_output)), about materialized view maintenance (see [“Maintaining materialized views”](ch11.html#sec_stream_mat_view)), and about
replicating changes from a database to derived data systems (see [“Change Data Capture”](ch11.html#sec_stream_cdc)).
