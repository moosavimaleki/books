By being clear about which data is derived from which other data, you can bring clarity to an
otherwise confusing system architecture. This point will be a running theme throughout this part of
the book. # Overview of Chapters We will start in [Chapter 10](ch10.html#ch_batch) by examining batch-oriented dataflow
systems such as MapReduce, and see how they give us good tools and principles for building
large-scale data systems. In [Chapter 11](ch11.html#ch_stream) we will take those ideas and
apply them to data streams, which allow us to do the same kinds of things with lower delays.
[Chapter 12](ch12.html#ch_future) concludes the book by exploring ideas about how we might
use these tools to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in the future.
