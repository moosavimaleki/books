
Cryptographic auditing and integrity checking often relies on Merkle trees
[[74](ch12.html#Merkle1987jk)],
which are trees of hashes that can be used to efficiently prove that a record appears in some
dataset (and a few other things). Outside of the hype of cryptocurrencies, certificate
transparency is a security technology that relies on Merkle trees to check the validity of TLS/SSL
certificates [[75](ch12.html#Laurie2014kr),
[76](ch12.html#Ryan2014iz)]. I could imagine integrity-checking and auditing algorithms, like those of certificate transparency
and distributed ledgers, becoming more widely used in data systems in general. Some work will be
needed to make them equally scalable as systems without cryptographic auditing, and to keep the
performance penalty as low as possible. But I think this is an interesting area to watch in the future. # Doing the Right Thing 
In the final section of this book, I would like to take a step back. Throughout this book we have
examined a wide range of different architectures for data systems, evaluated their pros and cons,
and explored techniques for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. However, we
have left out an important and fundamental part of the discussion, which I would now like to fill
in.
