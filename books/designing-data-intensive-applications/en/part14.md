We look primarily at the architecture of data systems and the ways they are integrated into
data-intensive applications. This book doesn’t have space to cover deployment, operations, security, management, and other areas—those are complex and important topics, and we wouldn’t do
them justice by making them superficial side notes in this book. They deserve books of their own. Many of the technologies described in this book fall within the realm of the Big Data buzzword.
However, the term “Big Data” is so overused and underdefined that it is not useful in a serious
engineering discussion. This book uses less ambiguous terms, such as single-node versus distributed
systems, or online/interactive versus offline/batch processing systems. This book has a bias toward free and open source software (FOSS), because reading, modifying, and
executing source code is a great way to understand how something works in detail. Open platforms
also reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. However, where appropriate, we also discuss proprietary
software (closed-source software, software as a service, or companies’ in-house software that is
only described in literature but not released publicly).
