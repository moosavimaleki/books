Other databases at that time forced application developers to think a lot about the internal
representation of the data in the database. The goal of the relational model was to hide that
implementation detail behind a cleaner interface. Over the years, there have been many competing approaches to data storage and querying. In the 1970s
and early 1980s, the network model and the hierarchical model were the main alternatives, but
the relational model came to dominate them. Object databases came and went again in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. XML databases appeared in the early 2000s, but have only seen niche adoption. Each
competitor to the relational model generated a lot of hype in its time, but it never lasted
[[2](ch02.html#Stonebraker2005wv)]. As computers became vastly more powerful and networked, they started being used for increasingly
diverse purposes. And remarkably, relational databases turned out to generalize very well, beyond
their original scope of business data processing, to a broad variety of use cases. Much of what you
see on the web today is still powered by relational databases, be it online publishing,
discussion, social networking, ecommerce, games, software-as-a-service productivity applications,
or much more.
