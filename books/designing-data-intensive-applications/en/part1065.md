Writing read events to durable storage thus enables better tracking of causal dependencies (see
[“Ordering events to capture causality”](#sec_future_capture_causality)), but it incurs additional storage and I/O cost. Optimizing such
systems to reduce the overhead is still an open research problem
[[2](ch12.html#Ajoux2015wh_ch12)]. But if you already log read requests
for operational purposes, as a side effect of request processing, it is not such a great change to
make the log the source of the requests instead. ### Multi-partition data processing 
For queries that only touch a single partition, the effort of sending queries through a stream and
collecting a stream of responses is perhaps overkill. However, this idea opens the possibility of
distributed execution of complex queries that need to combine data from several partitions, taking
advantage of the infrastructure for message routing, partitioning, and joining that is already
provided by stream processors. 
Storm’s distributed RPC feature supports this usage pattern (see [“Message passing and RPC”](ch11.html#sec_stream_actors_drpc)). For
example, it has been used to compute the number of people who have seen a URL on Twitter—i.e., the
union of the follower sets of everyone who has tweeted that URL
[[48](ch12.html#Marz2012wd)].
As the set of Twitter users is partitioned, this computation requires combining results from many
partitions.
