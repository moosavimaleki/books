When applications are deployed as microservices (see [“Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC”](ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_rpc)), a common
design choice is to deploy each service and its durable state as an independent unit, with no
durable state shared between services. When two events originate in different services, there is
no defined order for those events. *  Some applications maintain client-side state that is updated immediately on user input (without
waiting for confirmation from a server), and even continue to work offline (see
[“Clients with offline operation”](ch05.html#sec_replication_offline_clients)). With such applications, clients and servers are very likely
to see events in different orders. 
In formal terms, deciding on a total order of events is known as total order broadcast, which is
equivalent to consensus (see [“Consensus algorithms and total order broadcast”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_consensus_abcast)). Most consensus algorithms are
designed for situations in which the throughput of a single node is sufficient to process the entire
stream of events, and these algorithms do not provide a mechanism for multiple nodes to share the
work of ordering the events. It is still an open research problem to design consensus algorithms
that can scale beyond the throughput of a single node and that work well in a geographically
distributed setting.
