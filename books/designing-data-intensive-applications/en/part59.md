*  Preserving the organization’s knowledge about the system, even as individual people come and go Good operability means making routine tasks easy, allowing the operations team to focus their efforts
on high-value activities. Data systems can do various things to make routine tasks easy, including: *  Providing visibility into the runtime behavior and internals of the system, with good monitoring *  Providing good support for automation and integration with standard tools *  Avoiding dependency on individual machines (allowing machines to be taken down for maintenance
while the system as a whole continues running uninterrupted) *  Providing good documentation and an easy-to-understand operational model (“If I do X, Y will happen”) *  Providing good default behavior, but also giving administrators the freedom to override defaults when needed *  Self-healing where appropriate, but also giving administrators manual control over the system state when needed *  Exhibiting predictable behavior, minimizing surprises ## Simplicity: Managing Complexity
