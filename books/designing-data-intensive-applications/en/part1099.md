
Besides random memory corruption due to hardware faults or radiation, certain pathological memory
access patterns can flip bits even in memory that has no faults
[[62](ch12.html#Kim2014bn)]—an
effect that can be used to break security mechanisms in operating systems
[[63](ch12.html#Seaborn2015ve)] (this technique is known as rowhammer). Once you look closely, hardware isn’t quite
the perfect abstraction that it may seem. To be clear, random bit-flips are still very rare on modern hardware
[[64](ch12.html#Gray2005vg)]. I just want to point out that they are not beyond the realm of possibility,
and so they deserve some attention. ### Maintaining integrity in the face of software bugs 
Besides such hardware issues, there is always the risk of software bugs, which would not be caught
by lower-level network, memory, or filesystem checksums. Even widely used database software has
bugs: I have personally seen cases of MySQL failing to correctly maintain a uniqueness constraint
[[65](ch12.html#MySQL73170)]
and PostgreSQL’s serializable isolation level exhibiting write skew anomalies
[[66](ch12.html#Fredericks2015pg_ch12)], even though MySQL and PostgreSQL are robust and
well-regarded databases that have been battle-tested by many people for many years. In less mature
software, the situation is likely to be much worse.
