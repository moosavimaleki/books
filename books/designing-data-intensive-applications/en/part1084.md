
In the traditional approach to databases, executing this transaction would require an atomic commit
across all three partitions, which essentially forces it into a total order with respect to all
other transactions on any of those partitions. Since there is now cross-partition coordination,
different partitions can no longer be processed independently, so throughput is likely to suffer. 
However, it turns out that equivalent correctness can be achieved with partitioned logs, and without
an atomic commit: 1.  The request to transfer money from account A to account B is given a unique request ID by the
client, and appended to a log partition based on the request ID. 2.  A stream processor reads the log of requests. For each request message it emits two messages to
output streams: a debit instruction to the payer account A (partitioned by A), and a credit
instruction to the payee account B (partitioned by B). The original request ID is included in
those emitted messages.
