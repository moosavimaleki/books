
We saw this line of thinking in [“Databases and Streams”](ch11.html#sec_stream_databases), where we discussed treating the log of
changes to a database as a stream of events that we can subscribe to. Message-passing systems such
as actors (see [“Message-Passing Dataflow”](ch04.html#sec_encoding_dataflow_msg)) also have this concept of responding to events.
Already in the 1980s, the tuple spaces model explored expressing distributed computations in terms
of processes that observe state changes and react to them
[[38](ch12.html#Gelernter1985df),
[39](ch12.html#Eugster2003ih_ch12)]. As discussed, similar things happen inside a database when a trigger fires due to a data change, or
when a secondary index is updated to reflect a change in the table being indexed. Unbundling the
database means taking this idea and applying it to the creation of derived datasets outside of the
primary database: caches, full-text search indexes, machine learning, or analytics systems. We can
use stream processing and messaging systems for this purpose. The important thing to keep in mind is that maintaining derived data is not the same as asynchronous
job execution, for which messaging systems are traditionally designed (see
[“Logs compared to traditional messaging”](ch11.html#sec_stream_logs_vs_messaging)):
