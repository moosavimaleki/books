In particular, let’s focus on uniqueness constraints—such as the one we relied on in
[Example 12-2](#fig_future_request_id). In [“Constraints and uniqueness guarantees”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_uniqueness) we saw several other examples of
application features that need to enforce uniqueness: a username or email address must uniquely
identify a user, a file storage service cannot have more than one file with the same name, and two
people cannot book the same seat on a flight or in a theater. 
Other kinds of constraints are very similar: for example, ensuring that an account balance never goes
negative, that you don’t sell more items than you have in stock in the warehouse, or that a meeting
room does not have overlapping bookings. Techniques that enforce uniqueness can often be used for
these kinds of constraints as well. ### Uniqueness constraints require consensus 
In [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ch_consistency) we saw that in a distributed setting, enforcing a uniqueness constraint
requires consensus: if there are several concurrent requests with the same value, the system somehow
needs to decide which one of the conflicting operations is accepted, and reject the others as
violations of the constraint.
