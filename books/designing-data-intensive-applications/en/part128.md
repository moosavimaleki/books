
The semantic web is fundamentally a simple and reasonable idea: websites already publish information
as text and pictures for humans to read, so why don’t they also publish information as
machine-readable data for computers to read? The Resource Description Framework (RDF)
[[41](ch02.html#W3CRDF)] was intended as a mechanism for different websites
to publish data in a consistent format, allowing data from different websites to be automatically
combined into a web of data—a kind of internet-wide “database of everything.” Unfortunately, the semantic web was overhyped in the early 2000s but so far hasn’t shown any sign
of being realized in practice, which has made many people cynical about it. It has also suffered
from a dizzying plethora of acronyms, overly complex standards proposals, and hubris. However, if you look past those failings, there is also a lot of good work that has come out of the
semantic web project. Triples can be a good internal data model for applications, even if you have
no interest in publishing RDF data on the semantic web.
