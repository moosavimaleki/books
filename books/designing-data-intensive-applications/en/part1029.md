  Tools for windowing by event time, not by processing time, since processing time is meaningless
  when reprocessing historical events (see [“Reasoning About Time”](ch11.html#sec_stream_time)). For example, Apache Beam provides
  an API for expressing such computations, which can then be run using Apache Flink or Google Cloud
  Dataflow. # Unbundling Databases 
At a most abstract level, databases, Hadoop, and operating systems all perform the same functions:
they store some data, and they allow you to process and query that data
[[16](ch12.html#Ritchie1974gg)].
A database stores data in records of some data model (rows in tables, documents, vertices in a
graph, etc.) while an operating system’s filesystem stores data in files—but at their core, both
are “information management” systems
[[17](ch12.html#Brewer2011uh)]. As we saw in [Chapter 10](ch10.html#ch_batch), the Hadoop ecosystem is somewhat like a
distributed version of Unix. Of course, there are many practical differences. For example, many filesystems do not cope very well
with a directory containing 10 million small files, whereas a database containing 10 million small
records is completely normal and unremarkable. Nevertheless, the similarities and differences
between operating systems and databases are worth exploring.
