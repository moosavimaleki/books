backpressure 
Forcing the sender of some data to slow down because the recipient cannot keep up with it. Also
known as flow control. See [“Messaging Systems”](ch11.html#sec_stream_messaging). batch process 
A computation that takes some fixed (and usually large) set of data as input and produces some
other data as output, without modifying the input. See [Chapter 10](ch10.html#ch_batch). bounded 
Having some known upper limit or size. Used for example in the context of network delay (see
[“Timeouts and Unbounded Delays”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_queueing)) and datasets (see the introduction to [Chapter 11](ch11.html#ch_stream)). Byzantine fault 
A node that behaves incorrectly in some arbitrary way, for example by sending contradictory or
malicious messages to other nodes. See [“Byzantine Faults”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_byzantine). cache 
A component that remembers recently used data in order to speed up future reads of the same data.
It is generally not complete: thus, if some data is missing from the cache, it has to be fetched
from some underlying, slower data storage system that has a complete copy of the data.
