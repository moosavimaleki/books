##### Footnotes [i](ch10.html#idm140605758638848-marker) Some people love to point out that
cat is unnecessary here, as the input file could be given directly as an argument to
awk. However, the linear pipeline is more apparent when written like this. [ii](ch10.html#idm140605758320400-marker) Another example of a
uniform interface is URLs and HTTP, the foundations of the web. A URL identifies a particular thing
(resource) on a website, and you can link to any URL from any other website. A user with a web
browser can thus seamlessly jump between websites by following links, even though the servers may be
operated by entirely unrelated organizations. This principle seems obvious today, but it was a key insight
in making the web the success that it is today. Prior systems were not so uniform: for example,
in the era of bulletin board systems (BBSs), each system had its own phone number and baud rate
configuration. A reference from one BBS to another would have to be in the form of a phone number
and modem settings; the user would have to hang up, dial the other BBS, and then manually find the
information they were looking for. It wasnâ€™t possible to link directly to some piece of content
inside another BBS.
