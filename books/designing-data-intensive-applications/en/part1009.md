
We touched on the issue of integrating data systems in [“Keeping Systems in Sync”](ch11.html#sec_stream_sync). As the number of
different representations of the data increases, the integration problem becomes harder. Besides the
database and the search index, perhaps you need to keep copies of the data in analytics systems
(data warehouses, or batch and stream processing systems); maintain caches or denormalized versions
of objects that were derived from the original data; pass the data through machine learning,
classification, ranking, or recommendation systems; or send notifications based on changes to the
data. Surprisingly often I see software engineers make statements like, “In my experience, 99% of people
only need X” or “…don’t need X” (for various values of X). I think that such statements say more
about the experience of the speaker than about the actual usefulness of a technology. The range of
different things you might want to do with data is dizzyingly wide. What one person considers to be
an obscure and pointless feature may well be a central requirement for someone else. The need for
data integration often only becomes apparent if you zoom out and consider the dataflows across an
entire organization.
