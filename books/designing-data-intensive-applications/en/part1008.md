However, even if you perfectly understand the mapping between tools and circumstances for their use,
there is another challenge: in complex applications, data is often used in several different ways.
There is unlikely to be one piece of software that is suitable for all the
different circumstances in which the data is used, so you inevitably end up having to cobble
together several different pieces of software in order to provide your applicationâ€™s functionality. ## Combining Specialized Tools by Deriving Data 
For example, it is common to need to integrate an OLTP database with a full-text search index in
order to handle queries for arbitrary keywords. Although some databases (such as PostgreSQL) include
a full-text indexing feature, which can be sufficient for simple applications
[[1](ch12.html#Belaid2015tl)], more sophisticated search
facilities require specialist information retrieval tools. Conversely, search indexes are generally
not very suitable as a durable system of record, and so many applications need to combine two
different tools in order to satisfy all of the requirements.
