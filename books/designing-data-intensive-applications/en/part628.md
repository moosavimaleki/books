This chapter has been all about problems, and has given us a bleak outlook. In the next chapter we
will move on to solutions, and discuss some algorithms that have been designed to cope with all the
problems in distributed systems. ##### Footnotes [i](ch08.html#idm140605761218736-marker) With
one exception: we will assume that faults are non-Byzantine (see
[“Byzantine Faults”](#sec_distributed_byzantine)). [ii](ch08.html#idm140605760908512-marker) Except perhaps for an
occasional keepalive packet, if TCP keepalive is enabled. [iii](ch08.html#idm140605760900048-marker) Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) was a competitor to Ethernet in the 1980s
[[32](ch08.html#Keshav1997wb)], but it didn’t gain much adoption
outside of telephone network core switches. It has nothing to do with automatic teller machines
(also known as cash machines), despite sharing an acronym. Perhaps, in some parallel universe, the
internet is based on something like ATM—in that universe, internet video calls are probably a lot
more reliable than they are in ours, because they don’t suffer from dropped and delayed packets.
