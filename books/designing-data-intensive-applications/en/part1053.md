But why do you create the derived dataset in the first place? Most likely because you want to query
it again at a later time. This is the read path: when serving a user request you read from the
derived dataset, perhaps perform some more processing on the results, and construct the response to
the user. Taken together, the write path and the read path encompass the whole journey of the data, from the
point where it is collected to the point where it is consumed (probably by another human). The write
path is the portion of the journey that is precomputedâ€”i.e., that is done eagerly as soon as the
data comes in, regardless of whether anyone has asked to see it. The read path is the portion of the
journey that only happens when someone asks for it. If you are familiar with functional programming
languages, you might notice that the write path is similar to eager evaluation, and the read path is
similar to lazy evaluation.
