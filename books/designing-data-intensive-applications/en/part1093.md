*  Similarly, many airlines overbook airplanes in the expectation that some passengers will miss
their flight, and many hotels overbook rooms, expecting that some guests will cancel. In these
cases, the constraint of “one person per seat” is deliberately violated for business reasons, and
compensation processes (refunds, upgrades, providing a complimentary room at a neighboring hotel)
are put in place to handle situations in which demand exceeds supply. Even if there was no
overbooking, apology and compensation processes would be needed in order to deal with flights
being cancelled due to bad weather or staff on strike—recovering from such issues is just a normal
part of business [[3](ch12.html#Helland2009vd)]. *  If someone withdraws more money than they have in their account, the bank can charge them an
overdraft fee and ask them to pay back what they owe. By limiting the total withdrawals per day,
the risk to the bank is bounded.
