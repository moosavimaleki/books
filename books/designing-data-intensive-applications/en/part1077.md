
The end-to-end argument also applies to checking the integrity of data: checksums built into
Ethernet, TCP, and TLS can detect corruption of packets in the network, but they cannot detect
corruption due to bugs in the software at the sending and receiving ends of the network connection,
or corruption on the disks where the data is stored. If you want to catch all possible sources of
data corruption, you also need end-to-end checksums. 
A similar argument applies with encryption
[[55](ch12.html#Saltzer1984do_ch12)]:
the password on your home WiFi network protects against people snooping your WiFi traffic, but not
against attackers elsewhere on the internet; TLS/SSL between your client and the server protects
against network attackers, but not against compromises of the server. Only end-to-end encryption and
authentication can protect against all of these things. Although the low-level features (TCP duplicate suppression, Ethernet checksums, WiFi encryption)
cannot provide the desired end-to-end features by themselves, they are still useful, since they
reduce the probability of problems at the higher levels. For example, HTTP requests would often get
mangled if we didnâ€™t have TCP putting the packets back in the right order. We just need to remember
that the low-level reliability features are not by themselves sufficient to ensure end-to-end
correctness.
