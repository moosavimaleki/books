Despite considerable efforts in careful design, testing, and review, bugs still creep in. Although
they are rare, and they eventually get found and fixed, there is still a period during which such
bugs can corrupt data. 
When it comes to application code, we have to assume many more bugs, since most applications don’t
receive anywhere near the amount of review and testing that database code does. Many applications
don’t even correctly use the features that databases offer for preserving integrity, such as foreign
key or uniqueness constraints [[36](ch12.html#Bailis2015dn)]. 
Consistency in the sense of ACID (see [“Consistency”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_acid_consistency)) is based on the idea
that the database starts off in a consistent state, and a transaction transforms it from
one consistent state to another consistent state. Thus, we expect the database to always be in a
consistent state. However, this notion only makes sense if you assume that the transaction is free
from bugs. If the application uses the database incorrectly in some way, for example using a weak
isolation level unsafely, the integrity of the database cannot be guaranteed.
