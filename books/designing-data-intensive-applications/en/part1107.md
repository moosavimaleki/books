
It would be interesting to use cryptographic tools to prove the integrity of a system in a way that
is robust to a wide range of hardware and software issues, and even potentially malicious actions.
Cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Ripple, Stellar, and various others

have sprung up to explore this area. I am not qualified to comment on the merits of these technologies as currencies or mechanisms for
agreeing contracts. However, from a data systems point of view they contain some interesting ideas.
Essentially, they are distributed databases, with a data model and transaction mechanism, in which
different replicas can be hosted by mutually untrusting organizations. The replicas continually
check each other’s integrity and use a consensus protocol to agree on the transactions that should
be executed. 
I am somewhat skeptical about the Byzantine fault tolerance aspects of these technologies (see
[“Byzantine Faults”](ch08.html#sec_distributed_byzantine)), and I find the technique of proof of work (e.g., Bitcoin mining)
extraordinarily wasteful. The transaction throughput of Bitcoin is rather low, albeit for political
and economic reasons more than for technical ones. However, the integrity checking aspects are
interesting.
