rebalance 
To move data or services from one node to another in order to spread the load fairly. See
[“Rebalancing Partitions”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_rebalancing). replication 
Keeping a copy of the same data on several nodes (replicas) so that it remains accessible if a
node becomes unreachable. See [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch_replication). schema 
A description of the structure of some data, including its fields and datatypes. Whether some data
conforms to a schema can be checked at various points in the data’s lifetime (see
[“Schema flexibility in the document model”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_schema_flexibility)), and a schema can change over time (see [Chapter 4](ch04.html#ch_encoding)). secondary index 
An additional data structure that is maintained alongside the primary data storage and which
allows you to efficiently search for records that match a certain kind of condition. See
[“Other Indexing Structures”](ch03.html#sec_storage_other_indexing) and [“Partitioning and Secondary Indexes”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_secondary_indexes). serializable 
A guarantee that if several transactions execute concurrently, they behave the same as if they had
executed one at a time, in some serial order. See [“Serializability”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_serializability).
