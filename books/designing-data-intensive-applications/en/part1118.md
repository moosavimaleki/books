## Privacy and Tracking 
Besides the problems of predictive analytics—i.e., using data to make automated decisions about
people—there are ethical problems with data collection itself. What is the relationship between the
organizations collecting data and the people whose data is being collected? 
When a system only stores data that a user has explicitly entered, because they want the system to
store and process it in a certain way, the system is performing a service for the user: the user is
the customer. But when a user’s activity is tracked and logged as a side effect of other things they
are doing, the relationship is less clear. The service no longer just does what the user tells it to
do, but it takes on interests of its own, which may conflict with the user’s interests. Tracking behavioral data has become increasingly important for user-facing features of many online
services: tracking which search results are clicked helps improve the ranking of search results;
recommending “people who liked X also liked Y” helps users discover interesting and useful things;
A/B tests and user flow analysis can help indicate how a user interface might be improved. Those
features require some amount of tracking of user behavior, and users benefit from them.
