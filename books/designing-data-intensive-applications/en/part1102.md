
If you want to be sure that your data is still there, you have to actually read it and check. Most
of the time it will still be there, but if it isn’t, you really want to find out sooner rather than
later. By the same argument, it is important to try restoring from your backups from time to
time—otherwise you may only find out that your backup is broken when it is too late and you have
already lost data. Don’t just blindly trust that it is all working. ### A culture of verification 
Systems like HDFS and S3 still have to assume that disks work correctly most of the time—which is a
reasonable assumption, but not the same as assuming that they always work correctly.  However, not
many systems currently have this kind of “trust, but verify” approach of continually auditing
themselves. Many assume that correctness guarantees are absolute and make no provision for the
possibility of rare data corruption. I hope that in the future we will see more self-validating or
self-auditing systems that continually check their own integrity, rather than relying on blind
trust [[68](ch12.html#Kreps2012td_ch12)].
