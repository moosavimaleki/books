Within limited environments that are willing to pay the cost of distributed transactions, they have
been used successfully. However, I think that XA has poor fault tolerance and performance
characteristics (see [“Distributed Transactions in Practice”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_dist_trans)), which severely limit its usefulness. I believe
that it might be possible to create a better protocol for distributed transactions, but getting such
a protocol widely adopted and integrated with existing tools would be challenging, and unlikely to
happen soon. In the absence of widespread support for a good distributed transaction protocol, I believe that
log-based derived data is the most promising approach for integrating different data systems.
However, guarantees such as reading your own writes are useful, and I don’t think that it is
productive to tell everyone “eventual consistency is inevitable—suck it up and learn to deal with
it” (at least not without good guidance on how to deal with it). In [“Aiming for Correctness”](#sec_future_correctness) we will discuss some approaches for implementing stronger guarantees
on top of asynchronously derived systems, and work toward a middle ground between distributed
transactions and asynchronous log-based systems.
