
In many business contexts, it is actually acceptable to temporarily violate a constraint and fix
it up later by apologizing. The cost of the apology (in terms of money or reputation) varies, but it
is often quite low: you can’t unsend an email, but you can send a follow-up email with a
correction. If you accidentally charge a credit card twice, you can refund one of the
charges, and the cost to you is just the processing fees and perhaps a customer complaint. Once
money has been paid out of an ATM, you can’t directly get it back, although in principle you can
send debt collectors to recover the money if the account was overdrawn and the customer won’t pay
it back. Whether the cost of the apology is acceptable is a business decision. If it is acceptable, the
traditional model of checking all constraints before even writing the data is unnecessarily
restrictive, and a linearizable constraint is not needed. It may well be a reasonable choice to go
ahead with a write optimistically, and to check the constraint after the fact. You can still ensure
that the validation occurs before doing things that would be expensive to recover from, but that
doesn’t imply you must do the validation before you even write the data.
