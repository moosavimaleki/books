When predictive analytics affect people’s lives, particularly pernicious problems arise due to
self-reinforcing feedback loops. For example, consider the case of employers using credit scores to
evaluate potential hires. You may be a good worker with a good credit score, but suddenly find
yourself in financial difficulties due to a misfortune outside of your control. As you miss payments
on your bills, your credit score suffers, and you will be less likely to find work. Joblessness
pushes you toward poverty, which further worsens your scores, making it even harder to find
employment [[87](ch12.html#ONeil2016vh)]. It’s a downward spiral due to
poisonous assumptions, hidden behind a camouflage of mathematical rigor and data. 
We can’t always predict when such feedback loops happen. However, many consequences can be predicted
by thinking about the entire system (not just the computerized parts, but also the people
interacting with it)—an approach known as systems thinking
[[92](ch12.html#Meadows2008wq)].
We can try to understand how a data analysis system responds to different behaviors, structures, or
characteristics. Does the system reinforce and amplify existing differences between people (e.g.,
making the rich richer or the poor poorer), or does it try to combat injustice? And even with the
best intentions, we must beware of unintended consequences.
