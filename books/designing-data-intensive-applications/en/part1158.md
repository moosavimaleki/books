
Searching text by arbitrary keywords, often with additional features such as matching
similarly spelled words or synonyms. A full-text index is a kind of secondary index that
supports such queries. See [“Full-text search and fuzzy indexes”](ch03.html#sec_storage_full_text). graph 
A data structure consisting of vertices (things that you can refer to, also known as nodes or
entities) and edges (connections from one vertex to another, also known as relationships or
arcs). See [“Graph-Like Data Models”](ch02.html#sec_datamodels_graph). hash A function that turns an input into a random-looking number. The same input always returns the
same number as output. Two different inputs are very likely to have two different numbers as
output, although it is possible that two different inputs produce the same output (this is called
a collision). See [“Partitioning by Hash of Key”](ch06.html#sec_partitioning_hash). idempotent 
Describing an operation that can be safely retried; if it is executed more than once, it has the
same effect as if it was only executed once. See [“Idempotence”](ch11.html#sec_stream_idempotence).
