See [“Atomic Commit and Two-Phase Commit (2PC)”](ch09.html#sec_consistency_2pc). two-phase locking (2PL) 
An algorithm for achieving serializable isolation that works by a transaction acquiring a lock on
all data it reads or writes, and holding the lock until the end of the transaction. See
[“Two-Phase Locking (2PL)”](ch07.html#sec_transactions_2pl). unbounded 
Not having any known upper limit or size. The opposite of bounded.
