
These changing capabilities have led to a renewed interest in offline-first applications that do
as much as possible using a local database on the same device, without requiring an internet
connection, and sync with remote servers in the background when a network connection is available
[[42](ch12.html#Feyerke2013wd)]. Since mobile devices often have slow and unreliable
cellular internet connections, it’s a big advantage for users if their user interface does not have
to wait for synchronous network requests, and if apps mostly work offline (see
[“Clients with offline operation”](ch05.html#sec_replication_offline_clients)). When we move away from the assumption of stateless clients talking to a central database and
toward state that is maintained on end-user devices, a world of new opportunities opens up. In
particular, we can think of the on-device state as a cache of state on the server. The pixels on
the screen are a materialized view onto model objects in the client app; the model objects are a local
replica of state in a remote datacenter [[27](ch12.html#Kleppmann2014ht)].
