Very special thanks are due to Shabbir Diwan and Edie Freedman, who illustrated with great care the
maps that accompany the chapters. It’s wonderful that they took on the unconventional idea of
creating maps, and made them so beautiful and compelling. Finally, my love goes to my family and friends, without whom I would not have been able to get
through this writing process that has taken almost four years. You’re the best.
