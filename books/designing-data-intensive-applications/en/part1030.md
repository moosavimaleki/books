
Unix and relational databases have approached the information management problem with very different
philosophies. Unix viewed its purpose as presenting programmers with a logical but fairly low-level
hardware abstraction, whereas relational databases wanted to give application programmers a
high-level abstraction that would hide the complexities of data structures on disk, concurrency,
crash recovery, and so on. Unix developed pipes and files that are just sequences of bytes, whereas
databases developed SQL and transactions. Which approach is better? Of course, it depends what you want. Unix is “simpler” in the sense that
it is a fairly thin wrapper around hardware resources; relational databases are “simpler” in the
sense that a short declarative query can draw on a lot of powerful infrastructure (query
optimization, indexes, join methods, concurrency control, replication, etc.) without the author of
the query needing to understand the implementation details. 
The tension between these philosophies has lasted for decades (both Unix and the relational model
emerged in the early 1970s) and still isn’t resolved. For example, I would interpret the NoSQL
movement as wanting to apply a Unix-esque approach of low-level abstractions to the domain of
distributed OLTP data storage.
