
Where will these developments take us in the future? If we start from the premise that there is no
single data model or storage format that is suitable for all access patterns, I speculate that there
are two avenues by which different storage and processing tools can nevertheless be composed into a
cohesive system: Federated databases: unifying reads 
It is possible to provide a unified query interface to a wide variety of underlying storage
engines and processing methods—an approach known as a federated database or polystore
[[18](ch12.html#Stonebraker2015wu), [19](ch12.html#Duggan2015de)].
For example, PostgreSQL’s foreign data wrapper feature fits this pattern
[[20](ch12.html#Dybka2015bn)].
Applications that need a specialized data model or query interface can still access the underlying
storage engines directly, while users who want to combine data from disparate places can do so
easily through the federated interface. 
A federated query interface follows the relational tradition of a single integrated system with a
high-level query language and elegant semantics, but a complicated implementation.
