
As software and data are having such a large impact on the world, we engineers must remember that we
carry a responsibility to work toward the kind of world that we want to live in: a world that treats
people with humanity and respect. I hope that we can work together toward that goal. ##### Footnotes [i](ch12.html#idm140605755633424-marker) Explaining a joke rarely improves
it, but I don’t want anyone to feel left out. Here, Church is a reference to the
mathematician Alonzo Church, who created the lambda calculus, an early form of computation that is
the basis for most functional programming languages. The lambda calculus has no mutable state (i.e.,
no variables that can be overwritten), so one could say that mutable state is separate from Church’s
work. [ii](ch12.html#idm140605755583872-marker) In the microservices approach, you
could avoid the synchronous network request by caching the exchange rate locally in the service that
processes the purchase. However, in order to keep that cache fresh, you would need to periodically
poll for updated exchange rates, or subscribe to a stream of changes—which is exactly what happens
in the dataflow approach.
