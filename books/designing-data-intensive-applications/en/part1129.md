These observations have led critics to saying that data is not just an asset, but a “toxic asset”
[[101](ch12.html#Schneier2016tf)], or at least “hazardous material”
[[103](ch12.html#Scott2016cq)]. Even if we think that we are capable of preventing
abuse of data, whenever we collect data, we need to balance the benefits with the risk of it falling
into the wrong hands: computer systems may be compromised by criminals or hostile foreign
intelligence services, data may be leaked by insiders, the company may fall into the hands of
unscrupulous management that does not share our values, or the country may be taken over by a regime
that has no qualms about compelling us to hand over the data. When collecting data, we need to consider not just today’s political environment, but all possible
future governments. There is no guarantee that every government elected in future will respect human
rights and civil liberties, so “it is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday
facilitate a police state” [[104](ch12.html#Schneier2013qj)].
