
A client sees different parts of the database at different points in time. This issue is most
commonly prevented with snapshot isolation, which allows a transaction to read from a consistent
snapshot at one point in time. It is usually implemented with multi-version concurrency control
(MVCC). Lost updates Two clients concurrently perform a read-modify-write cycle. One overwrites the otherâ€™s write
without incorporating its changes, so data is lost. Some implementations of snapshot isolation
prevent this anomaly automatically, while others require a manual lock (SELECT FOR UPDATE). Write skew A transaction reads something, makes a decision based on the value it saw, and writes the decision
to the database. However, by the time the write is made, the premise of the decision is no longer
true. Only serializable isolation prevents this anomaly. Phantom reads A transaction reads objects that match some search condition. Another client makes a write that
affects the results of that search. Snapshot isolation prevents straightforward phantom reads, but
phantoms in the context of write skew require special treatment, such as index-range locks.
